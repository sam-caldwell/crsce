## Abstract

Cross-Sums Compression and Expansion (CRSCE) compresses a fixed-size two-dimensional binary matrix---the Cross-Sum
Matrix (CSM)---by replacing it with four families of exact-sum projections (row, column, diagonal, and anti-diagonal
sums) together with independent per-row SHA-256 digests. Decompression is a constrained reconstruction problem: recover
a matrix consistent with all projections and row hashes. Although per-row SHA-256 digests make non-uniqueness
astronomically unlikely under standard cryptographic assumptions, non-uniqueness is not logically impossible. This paper
formalizes a *disambiguated* decompression process in which the compressor discovers a *canonical, zero-based*
disambiguation index (DI) identifying the original matrix among all feasible reconstructions and appends that DI to the
compressed payload. The compressor is permitted to fail if DI discovery exceeds a single tolerance parameter,
`max_compression_time`, forcing a fallback to alternative compression. We develop the theory as a constraint
satisfaction problem (CSP) over a factor graph, analyze the computational implications of solution enumeration, and
present a deterministic solver design that combines incremental constraint propagation with belief-propagation-guided
branching heuristics.

## 1. Introduction

In the CRSCE scheme, an input bitstream is subdivided into blocks of approximately 32 KB. Each block is placed into $CSM
\in \{0,1\}^{s \times s}$ with fixed size $s = 511$. Four cross-sum vectors are computed from $CSM$: row sums (LSM),
column sums (VSM), diagonal sums (DSM), and anti-diagonal sums (XSM). An independent SHA-256 digest is also computed for
each row, producing the lateral hash vector (LH). A disambiguation index (DI) is appended to handle the rare case of
non-unique reconstruction. The compressed representation of each block is therefore the tuple $(\text{LH}, \text{DI},
\text{LSM}, \text{VSM}, \text{DSM}, \text{XSM})$.

Compression is realized because the cross-sum vectors and hash vector are smaller than the original matrix. LSM and VSM
each contain $s$ elements and each element requires $b = \lceil \log_2(s+1) \rceil$ bits. DSM and XSM each contain $2s -
1$ elements, but because straight diagonals have variable lengths ranging from 1 to $s$, each diagonal sum is encoded in
$\lceil \log_2(\text{len}(k)+1) \rceil$ bits, where $\text{len}(k) = \min(k+1,\; s,\; 2s-1-k)$ for diagonal index $k$.
The result defines the total bits for one diagonal family as:

$$
    B_d(s) = \lceil \log_2(s+1) \rceil + 2 \sum_{l=1}^{s-1} \lceil \log_2(l+1) \rceil
$$

LH consists of $s$ rows of 256 bits each. The disambiguation index (DI) is encoded as a fixed 8-bit unsigned integer per
block, permitting up to 256 feasible reconstructions before the compressor must fail. The per-block compression ratio is
therefore:

$$
    C_r = 1 - \frac{2sb + 2 B_d(s) + 256s + 8}{s^2}
$$

where $s = 511$,

$$
    b = \lceil \log_2(s+1) \rceil = 9, \quad B_d(511) = 8{,}185
$$

Thus,

$$
    C_r = 1 - \frac{9{,}198 + 16{,}370 + 130{,}816 + 8}{261{,}121} = 1 - \frac{156{,}392}{261{,}121} \approx 0.4011
$$

This means for any given suitable input, CRSCE is *guaranteed* to realize approximately 40.1% compression per block.
This excludes any additional compressed file format header information.

Decompression inverts this mapping: reconstruct $CSM$ given the stored constraints. The central difficulty is
computational: the feasible set of $CSM$ consistent with all sum constraints may be large, and finding *the* correct
$CSM$ is a constrained search problem. The SHA-256 row digests transform the problem from "find any feasible matrix"
into "find a feasible matrix whose rows match $s$ given digests," which, under standard cryptographic assumptions,
should make accidental ambiguity negligible (NIST, 2015; Dang, 2012).

However, negligible is not zero. Moreover, determinism requirements ("exactly one output for a given compressed
payload") require a defined behavior even in the pathological case of multiple feasible reconstructions. This paper
proposes a process-level remedy: define a canonical total order over feasible solutions and encode a zero-based DI
selecting the intended solution. Importantly, the DI is discovered at compression time by running the decompressor as an
enumerator with the original uncompressed matrix as the target.

Because solution enumeration can be expensive, the process is explicitly *time-bounded* by a single compressor
parameter, `max_compression_time`; if exceeded, compression fails and the caller must use an alternative algorithm. The
remainder of the paper builds a defensible theoretical foundation, then presents a deterministic solver design suitable
for modern hardware with both CPU and GPU resources.

## 2. Formal Problem Statement and Notation

### 2.1 Matrix Model

Let $s = 511$. For decompression, let the unknown matrix be

$$
    CSM = (CSM_{r,c}) \in \{0,1\}^{s \times s}, \quad r,c \in \{0, \ldots, s-1\}.
$$

The compressor serializes input bits into the $CSM$ in a deterministic row-major mapping (the precise mapping is assumed
fixed by the format specification).

### 2.2 Cross-Sum Constraints

Define the four projection families as exact cardinality constraints:

**Row sums (LSM):**

$$
    \forall r: \quad \sum_{c=0}^{s-1} CSM_{r,c} = \text{LSM}[r].
$$

**Column sums (VSM):**

$$
    \forall c: \quad \sum_{r=0}^{s-1} CSM_{r,c} = \text{VSM}[c].
$$

**Straight diagonal sums (DSM):**

For diagonal index $d \in \{0, \ldots, 2s-2\}$, define $\text{len}(d) = \min(d+1,\; s,\; 2s-1-d)$.
The diagonal $d$ consists of all cells $(r, c)$ satisfying $c - r = d - (s-1)$ with $0 \leq r,c \leq s-1$:

$$
    \forall d: \quad \sum_{\substack{(r,c) \,:\, c - r = d-(s-1) \\ 0 \leq r,c \leq s-1}} CSM_{r,c} = \text{DSM}[d].
$$

Each diagonal sum is encoded in $\lceil \log_2(\text{len}(d)+1) \rceil$ bits.

**Straight anti-diagonal sums (XSM):**

For anti-diagonal index $x \in \{0, \ldots, 2s-2\}$, define $\text{len}(x) = \min(x+1,\; s,\; 2s-1-x)$. The
anti-diagonal $x$ consists of all cells $(r, c)$ satisfying $r + c = x$ with $0 \leq r,c \leq s-1$:

$$
    \forall x: \quad \sum_{\substack{(r,c) \,:\, r + c = x \\ 0 \leq r,c \leq s-1}} CSM_{r,c} = \text{XSM}[x].
$$

Each anti-diagonal sum is encoded in $\lceil \log_2(\text{len}(x)+1) \rceil$ bits.

Each cell participates in exactly four sum constraints: one row, one column, one straight diagonal, and one straight
anti-diagonal.

#### 2.2.1 Cross-Sum Partition Axioms

The four projection families defined above are specific instances of a general class of *cross-sum partitions* over the
matrix $CSM \in \{0,1\}^{s \times s}$. Any valid cross-sum partition $\mathcal{P}$ must satisfy the following three
axioms.

**Axiom 1 (Conservation).** Every cross-sum vector must sum to the same value: the Hamming weight of the matrix.
Formally, let $\mathcal{P} = \{L_0, L_1, \ldots, L_{n-1}\}$ be a partition of the $s^2$ cells into $n$ lines, and let
$\sigma(L_k) = \sum_{(r,c) \in L_k} CSM_{r,c}$ denote the sum along line $L_k$. Then for any two valid cross-sum
partitions $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$:

$$
    \sum_{L \in \mathcal{P}} \sigma(L) = \sum_{L \in \mathcal{Q}} \sigma(L) = \|CSM\|_1 = \sum_{r=0}^{s-1} \sum_{c=0}^{s-1} CSM_{r,c}.
$$

This follows directly from the partition property: each partition covers every cell exactly once, so the grand total of
all line sums equals the total number of ones in the matrix, regardless of partition geometry.

**Axiom 2 (Uniqueness).** No two lines, whether within the same partition or across distinct partitions, may cover the
identical set of cells. Formally, for any two lines $L_i$ and $L_j$ (from any partitions):

$$
    L_i \neq L_j \implies L_i \not\equiv L_j \quad \text{(as sets of cell indices)}.
$$

This ensures that every line contributes an independent constraint. A duplicate line would provide redundant information,
wasting storage without reducing ambiguity in the reconstruction problem.

**Axiom 3 (Non-repetition).** Each line must reference each cell of $CSM$ at most once. Formally, for every line $L_k$
in every partition $\mathcal{P}$, $L_k$ is a *set* (not a multiset) of cell indices:

$$
    \forall (r,c) \in L_k: \quad \bigl|\{i : L_k[i] = (r,c)\}\bigr| = 1.
$$

This prevents a single line from double-counting a cell, which would distort the sum and violate the semantic
interpretation of $\sigma(L_k)$ as an exact cardinality constraint over distinct Boolean variables.

Together, these three axioms ensure that every cross-sum partition induces a well-defined system of cardinality
constraints whose grand totals are mutually consistent, whose individual constraints are non-redundant, and whose
variable references are exact. The four families defined in Section 2.2 (LSM, VSM, DSM, XSM) each satisfy all three
axioms, and any future extension of the projection system (e.g., additional geometric partitions to accelerate solver
convergence) must likewise conform to these requirements.

### 2.3 Row Hash Constraints (LH)

For each row $r$, define the row bitstring

$$
    \text{row}_r = CSM_{r,0} \| CSM_{r,1} \| \cdots \| CSM_{r,s-1} \| 0
$$

as a message of length $s + 1 = 512$ bits. The trailing zero bit is a fixed padding constant that ensures byte alignment
(512 bits = 64 bytes), simplifying implementation without affecting the hash's discriminative power between distinct
rows. Let

$$
    H(\text{row}_r) = \text{SHA-256}(\text{row}_r),
$$

and require

$$
    \forall r: \quad H(\text{row}_r) = \text{LH}[r].
$$

SHA-256 is standardized in FIPS 180-4, including message padding and parsing into 512-bit blocks (NIST, 2015).

### 2.4 Decompression Objective

Given the constraint set $\mathcal{C} = (s, \text{LSM}, \text{VSM}, \text{DSM}, \text{XSM}, \text{LH})$, decompression
seeks a $CSM$ satisfying all constraints. The premise that $\mathcal{C}$ admits exactly one feasible matrix is a design
intent, not a mathematical guarantee; the cross-sum and hash constraints make non-uniqueness astronomically unlikely but
cannot logically exclude it. The full compressed payload $\mathcal{C}' = (\text{LH}, \text{DI}, \text{LSM}, \text{VSM},
\text{DSM}, \text{XSM})$ therefore includes an 8-bit disambiguation index (DI) that selects the intended reconstruction
from the canonical enumeration of feasible solutions (Section 4). It is the DI that provides the "exactly one solution"
guarantee: even if $\mathcal{C}$ admits multiple feasible matrices, $\mathcal{C}'$ identifies precisely one.

## 3. Theoretical Foundations

### 3.1 Constraint Satisfaction and Factor-Graph View

The decompression problem is naturally a CSP over $s^2$ Boolean variables with $6s - 2$ cardinality constraints plus $s$
hash-equality constraints. For $s = 511$ this expands to:

$$
    s^2 = 261{,}121 \text{ Boolean variables}
$$

$$
    \underbrace{511}_{\text{row}} +
    \underbrace{511}_{\text{column}} +
    \underbrace{1{,}021}_{\text{diagonal}} +
    \underbrace{1{,}021}_{\text{anti-diagonal}} = 3{,}064 \text{ cardinality constraints}
$$

$$
    511 \text{ SHA-256 row-hash constraints}
$$

$$
    3{,}064 + 511 = 3{,}575 \text{ total constraints}
$$

This can also be represented as a factor graph: variable nodes for each $CSM_{r,c}$, factor nodes for each
row/column/diagonal/anti-diagonal sum constraint, and factor nodes for each SHA-256 row constraint. Factor graphs
support message-passing interpretations (Kschischang et al., 2001).

In principle, belief propagation (BP) or its generalizations can provide probabilistic guidance in large constraint
systems, especially when exact inference is intractable (Yedidia et al., 2002; Wainwright & Jordan, 2008). In practice,
the exact-sum constraints are hard factors (zero probability when violated), while the hash factors are extremely sharp:
for a fully specified row, either the digest matches or it does not.

### 3.2 Cryptographic Uniqueness as a Heuristic, Not a Proof

SHA-256 is designed so that, absent structural weaknesses, finding distinct messages with the same digest is
computationally infeasible; NIST guidance frames security strength for applications that rely on hash properties (Dang,
2012; NIST, 2015). From a modeling perspective, treating $H$ as a random mapping from 511-bit strings to 256-bit
digests, the expected number of 511-bit preimages for any fixed digest value is $2^{511}/2^{256} = 2^{255}$, so hashes
alone do not uniquely identify a row among all possible rows. However, the decompressor is not choosing among all rows;
it is choosing among rows that participate in a globally consistent $CSM$ satisfying four families of sum constraints.
The heuristic claim is that the intersection "sum-feasible" $\cap$ "row-hash-matching" is typically singleton.

This is a plausible engineering assumption but remains a heuristic: it does not exclude adversarially constructed
instances or rare coincidences.

### 3.3 Estimating the Probability of Non-Unique Reconstruction

Section 3.2 argued qualitatively that hash-backed uniqueness is a heuristic. This section estimates the probability of
non-uniqueness quantitatively under a random-oracle model for SHA-256. The analysis proceeds in two stages: first
estimating the probability that an alternative matrix satisfies the cross-sum constraints alone, then combining this
with the per-row hash collision barrier.

**Cross-sum collision probability.** For a second feasible matrix $CSM'$ to match the original $CSM$ on all four
cross-sum families, each row must independently have identical Hamming weight to the corresponding original row.
Treating both matrices as independent draws from the uniform distribution over $\{0,1\}^{s \times s}$, the probability
that two independent $s$-bit rows share the same Hamming weight is given by the central binomial coefficient:

$$
    P(\text{row-sum match}) = \frac{\binom{2s}{s}}{4^s}.
$$

For $s = 511$, Stirling's approximation yields $\log_{10} P \approx -1.603$. Since the $s$ row sums are independent
under the uniform model, the probability that all $s$ rows match simultaneously is:

$$
    P(\text{LSM collision}) = \left[\frac{\binom{2s}{s}}{4^s}\right]^s \approx 10^{-819.08}.
$$

This bound is conservative: it considers only the row-sum (LSM) family. A complete alternative matrix must also match
all $s$ column sums, $2s - 1$ diagonal sums, and $2s - 1$ anti-diagonal sums, each of which imposes additional
independent constraints that further reduce the probability.

**Lateral hash collision probability.** Even if an alternative matrix satisfies all cross-sum constraints, it must also
pass independent per-row SHA-256 verification. Under the random-oracle assumption, each of the $s$ row hashes must
independently collide with the original digest. The probability that all $s$ rows collide simultaneously is:

$$
    P(\text{LH collision}) = \left(\frac{1}{2^{256}}\right)^s = 2^{-256s} = 2^{-130{,}816}.
$$

Converting to base 10: $\log_{10} P(\text{LH collision}) = -130{,}816 \times \log_{10} 2 \approx -39{,}379.54$.

**Combined collision probability.** Treating the cross-sum and hash collision events as independent (a conservative
assumption, since in practice the constraints are correlated and further reduce the joint probability):

$$
    P_{\text{CRSCE}} \leq P(\text{LSM collision}) \times P(\text{LH collision}) \approx 10^{-819}
    \times 10^{-39{,}380} \approx 10^{-40{,}199}.
$$

A probability of $\sim 10^{-40{,}199}$ is not merely negligible in a practical sense---it exceeds the security margin of
any deployed cryptographic system by many orders of magnitude. For context, the estimated number of atoms in the
observable universe is approximately $10^{80}$, and the probability of a spontaneous SHA-256 collision under
birthday-bound assumptions is approximately $2^{-128} \approx 10^{-38.5}$. The CRSCE collision probability is smaller
than either by a factor exceeding $10^{40{,}000}$.

This analysis assumes SHA-256 behaves as a random oracle, which is standard for non-adversarial settings. Under
adversarial conditions (e.g., a crafted input designed to induce collisions), the analysis does not apply, but the DI
mechanism (Section 2.4) provides deterministic correctness regardless of collision probability.

### 3.4 Enumeration and Indexing: Why Worst Cases Can Be Hard

The proposed disambiguation mechanism depends on enumerating feasible solutions. Even when *finding one* solution is
tractable in some structured settings, *counting* or *enumerating* solutions is often much harder in general;
\#P-completeness results (e.g., via Valiant's theorem for counting perfect matchings / permanents) illustrate that
counting can be intractable even when related decision problems are easier (Valiant, 1979).

SAT/SMT research treats "AllSAT" as a distinct, often expensive task: enumerating all satisfying assignments can
dominate runtime and memory, and specialized methods exist to mitigate the cost (e.g., blocking and non-blocking
strategies) (Kobler et al., 2025). The relevance here is not that CRSCE decompression is literally SAT, but that
solution enumeration in combinatorial constraint systems can be intrinsically expensive. Therefore, any indexing-based
disambiguation must explicitly define a failure mode---hence the single time tolerance parameter.

### 3.5 Ranking-Based DI Discovery as an Alternative to Enumeration

The compressor's DI discovery algorithm (Section 4.3) enumerates feasible solutions in canonical order until it finds
the original $CSM$. If $\text{DI} = 0$, the first candidate matches and the cost is minimal. When $\text{DI} > 0$,
however, the compressor must produce and discard $\text{DI}$ complete solutions before reaching the target. This section
considers an alternative strategy that exploits the compressor's knowledge of the original $CSM$.

The key observation is that the compressor is solving a *ranking* problem: given a specific element (the original $CSM$)
and a total order (lexicographic), determine its zero-based position among all feasible solutions. In combinatorics,
ranking is often more efficient than full enumeration. For example, ranking a permutation in lexicographic order
requires $O(n)$ operations rather than enumerating all prior permutations (Knuth, 2005).

For CRSCE, a ranking approach would proceed as follows. At each branching point $(r, c)$ in the DFS, the compressor
knows $CSM_{r,c}$. If the enumerator's lex-first branch (value 0) disagrees with the original (value 1), then every
feasible solution in the 0-subtree lexicographically precedes the original. Rather than enumerating these solutions
individually, the compressor could *count* them and add the count to a running DI accumulator, then follow the 1-branch
directly.

This transforms DI discovery from solution enumeration into a sequence of subtree-counting steps. The DI is the sum of
subtree counts for every branching point where the canonical first branch disagrees with the original:

$$
    \text{DI} = \sum_{\substack{(r,c) \text{ branching} \\
    \text{points where} \\
    CSM_{r,c} = 1}} \left| \{ \text{feasible solutions in the 0-subtree at } (r,c) \} \right|.
$$

Subtree counting in a general CSP is \#P-hard (Valiant, 1979), so this does not eliminate worst-case intractability.
However, the approach admits practical optimizations. When constraint propagation forces most cells in a subtree, the
effective degrees of freedom are small and exact counting may be tractable via dynamic programming over the remaining
line residuals. A hybrid strategy can attempt counting at each branch point and fall back to enumeration if counting
exceeds a local time budget, yielding a best-effort ranking that degrades gracefully to the baseline enumerator.

This ranking perspective also connects to the broader literature on counting under constraints, including approximate
counting via Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and fully polynomial randomized approximation schemes (FPRAS) for related
problems (Jerrum et al., 2004). While approximate counting would not yield an exact DI, it could provide upper bounds
useful for early termination decisions.

## 4. Canonical Solution Indexing as Format-Level Disambiguation

### 4.1 Canonical Ordering

Let $\text{vec}(CSM) \in \{0,1\}^{s^2}$ be the row-major bitstring:

$$
    \text{vec}(CSM) = CSM_{0,0} \| CSM_{0,1} \| \cdots \| CSM_{0,s-1} \| CSM_{1,0} \| \cdots \| CSM_{s-1,s-1}.
$$

Define a strict total order $<_{\text{lex}}$ on matrices by lexicographic order on $\text{vec}(CSM)$, with $0 < 1$.

The *canonical enumeration* of solutions is the sequence:

$$
    S_0 <_{\text{lex}} S_1 <_{\text{lex}} \cdots
$$

where each $S_k$ is a feasible $CSM$ satisfying all constraints in $\mathcal{C}$.

### 4.2 Disambiguation Index (DI)

The compressed representation is extended to:

$$\mathcal{C}' = (\text{LH}, \text{DI}, \text{LSM}, \text{VSM}, \text{DSM}, \text{XSM}),$$

where DI is an unsigned 8-bit integer, selecting the intended reconstruction:

$$
    D(\mathcal{C}') = S_{\text{DI}}.
$$

This creates a fully deterministic decompression mapping *even if* $\mathcal{C}$ has multiple feasible reconstructions.
If the original matrix's position in the canonical enumeration exceeds 255, compression fails; this is subsumed by the
`max_compression_time` failure mode, since enumerating that many solutions would almost certainly exceed any practical
time bound.

### 4.3 Compressor-Side DI Discovery

Compression proceeds as usual to compute $\mathcal{C}$, then discovers the DI by running the decompressor to compare
candidates to the known original $CSM$. If the decompressor yields solutions in canonical order, the compressor can stop
as soon as the candidate equals $CSM$, and the zero-based index of that candidate is the correct DI. Later, during
decompression, the decompressor proceeds to $S_{\text{DI}}$ to successfully reconstruct the original payload.

Notably, the compressor does not need to enumerate solutions *after* the match. This bounds work to "solutions up to the
target" rather than all solutions, but the target could still be late in the order.

### 4.4 Single Tolerance Parameter: Time-Bounded Compression

To avoid unbounded compression runs where the compressor fails to discover the correct DI, define one and only one
tolerance parameter: `max_compression_time`, a wall-clock limit on the entire compression operation including DI
discovery.

If the limit is exceeded before the compressor identifies the target $CSM$, compression fails. The output is not
produced (or is flagged invalid by container rules). This makes the algorithm explicitly "best-effort" over inputs: it
is permitted to reject inputs that induce excessive ambiguity or excessive enumeration cost.

## 5. Making the Theory Implementable: Deterministic Decompression by Constraint Propagation + Backtracking

### 5.1 Deterministic State Representation

The deterministic solver maintains a compact state for each line (row, column, diagonal, and anti-diagonal) that enables
incremental constraint propagation as cells are assigned. This representation allows the solver to detect infeasibility
early, force deterministic assignments when only one value is possible, and verify completed rows against their SHA-256
digests without recomputing from scratch.

For each line $L$, the solver tracks four quantities: $u(L)$, the count of unknown cells on the line; $a(L)$, the count
of assigned ones; the required sum $S(L)$ from the corresponding cross-sum vector (LSM, VSM, DSM, or XSM); and the
residual $\rho(L) = S(L) - a(L)$.

A line is feasible iff

$$0 \leq \rho(L) \leq u(L).$$

When $\rho(L) = 0$, all unknown cells on $L$ are forced to $0$. When $\rho(L) = u(L)$, all unknown cells on $L$ are
forced to $1$. These are standard feasibility rules for cardinality constraints, and they can be applied repeatedly
until reaching a fixpoint.

Each assignment $CSM_{r,c} \leftarrow 0/1$ updates exactly four lines' $(u, a, \rho)$, enabling incremental propagation.

### 5.2 Integrating Row Hash Checks Deterministically

Row-hash constraints are most effective once a row becomes fully assigned. When $u(\text{row } r) = 0$, compute SHA-256
of the 511-bit row message and compare to $\text{LH}[r]$. A mismatch yields an immediate contradiction and triggers
backtracking. SHA-256 preprocessing rules (padding and parsing) must follow FIPS 180-4 exactly to ensure
interoperability (NIST, 2015).

This approach does *not* require representing SHA-256 as a boolean circuit; it relies on exact evaluation at the moment
the row becomes concrete, which is straightforward to implement and deterministic.

### 5.3 Canonical Branching to Support Enumeration

To enumerate solutions in lexicographic order, choose the first unassigned cell in row-major order:

$$(r^*, c^*) = \min\{(r,c) : CSM_{r,c} \text{ unassigned}\}$$

under lex order of indices. Then branch by assigning $0$ first, then $1$. This ensures that the first found complete
solution is $S_0$, the second is $S_1$, etc., assuming the solver is otherwise deterministic.

### 5.4 Pseudocode: Deterministic Enumerator

The enumerator is the core algorithmic primitive upon which both compression and decompression depend. Its purpose is to
produce every feasible reconstruction of $CSM$ in strict lexicographic order, yielding each solution as it is found. The
algorithm combines depth-first search (DFS) with incremental constraint propagation, and the interaction between these
two mechanisms is what makes reconstruction tractable in practice despite the enormous search space.

The procedure begins by initializing all $s^2$ cells as unassigned and computing the initial line statistics $(u, a,
\rho)$ for every row, column, diagonal, and anti-diagonal. Before any branching occurs, the propagator runs to fixpoint
on the initial state: lines whose residual $\rho$ equals zero force all their unknowns to $0$, and lines whose residual
equals the unknown count force all their unknowns to $1$. These forced assignments may cascade, since each forced cell
updates four lines and may trigger further forcing on any of them. If propagation detects infeasibility---a negative
residual or a residual exceeding the unknown count on any line---the constraint set is inconsistent and no solutions
exist.

Once the initial propagation stabilizes, the DFS selects the first unassigned cell in row-major order and branches on
it, trying $0$ before $1$. This branching discipline is what establishes the lexicographic enumeration order: because
every cell is explored with $0$ first, the first complete assignment found is the lexicographically smallest feasible
matrix $S_0$, the second is $S_1$, and so on. After each tentative assignment, the propagator again runs to fixpoint,
forcing any cells that become determined as a consequence. If propagation succeeds, the DFS recurses to the next
unassigned cell; if it fails, the solver restores the state to the save point prior to the assignment (via an undo
stack) and tries the alternative value. When both values at a cell lead to infeasibility, the solver backtracks further
up the tree.

The `Propagate()` subroutine referenced below applies the feasibility rules from Section 5.1 to a queue of affected
lines until quiescence. It returns false if any line becomes infeasible or if any completed row fails its SHA-256
digest check (Section 5.2).

    DFS(0)
```

### 5.5 Pseudocode: Decompression with DI

Decompression consumes the full compressed payload $\mathcal{C}' = (\text{LH}, \text{DI}, \text{LSM}, \text{VSM},
\text{DSM}, \text{XSM})$ and must return exactly one matrix: the $\text{DI}$-th feasible reconstruction in canonical
lexicographic order. The algorithm achieves this by invoking the enumerator from Section 5.4 and simply counting
yielded solutions until the counter reaches the stored DI value. The solution at that index is the original $CSM$, and
the decompressor returns it immediately without examining any subsequent candidates.

In the overwhelmingly common case where the constraint set admits only one feasible matrix (Section 3.3), $\text{DI} =
0$ and the decompressor returns the very first solution the enumerator produces. The counting loop exists solely to
handle the rare case of non-unique reconstruction, where the DI disambiguates among multiple valid matrices. If the
enumerator exhausts all feasible solutions before reaching the DI-th candidate, the compressed payload is malformed and
the decompressor raises an error. This cannot occur for payloads produced by a correct compressor, but the check
provides defense-in-depth against data corruption or truncation.

```text
Algorithm 2: DecompressWithDI(C')
Input:  C' = (LH, DI, LSM, VSM, DSM, XSM)
Output: S_DI

k <- 0
for CSM in EnumerateSolutionsLex(C):
    if k == DI:
        return CSM
    k <- k + 1
error: DI out of range (no such solution)
```

### 5.6 Pseudocode: Compression with Time-Bounded DI Discovery

Compression is the inverse process: given the original matrix $CSM$, produce the compressed payload $\mathcal{C}'$
including the correct disambiguation index. The compressor first computes the four cross-sum vectors and the per-row
SHA-256 digests deterministically from the original matrix---this is straightforward arithmetic and hashing. The
difficult step is discovering the DI, which requires determining the original matrix's position in the canonical
enumeration of all feasible solutions.

The compressor discovers the DI by running the same enumerator used in decompression and comparing each yielded
candidate to the known original. When a candidate matches the original, its zero-based index becomes the DI, and the
compressor emits the complete payload. This design ensures that compression and decompression are compatible by
construction: both use the identical enumerator, so the $k$-th solution produced during compression is guaranteed to be
the same as the $k$-th solution produced during decompression.

Because enumeration can be expensive in pathological cases (Section 3.4), the compressor is governed by a single
tolerance parameter, `max_compression_time`, which caps the wall-clock duration of the entire operation. If the timer
expires before the enumerator yields a candidate matching the original, the compressor returns FAIL rather than
producing a potentially incorrect or incomplete payload. This explicit failure mode is a deliberate design choice: the
caller is expected to fall back to an alternative compression algorithm for blocks that CRSCE cannot handle within the
time budget. The time bound also implicitly caps the DI value, since the enumerator must produce $\text{DI} + 1$
complete solutions before succeeding; in practice, any DI large enough to challenge the 8-bit encoding limit (255) would
almost certainly also exceed a reasonable time bound.

If the enumerator exhausts all feasible solutions without finding the original matrix, the constraints are inconsistent
with the input---an implementation error, since the cross-sums and hashes were computed directly from $CSM$. The
compressor returns FAIL in this case as well, providing a safety net against bugs in the constraint computation or
enumerator logic.

```text
Algorithm 3: Compress(CSM, max_compression_time)
Input:  original matrix CSM, time limit T
Output: compressed payload C' or FAIL

StartTimer()

Compute LSM, VSM, DSM, XSM from CSM
Compute LH[r] = SHA256(row_r) for all r    // per FIPS 180-4

k <- 0
for Y in EnumerateSolutionsLex(C):
    if ElapsedTime() > T:
        return FAIL
    if Y == CSM:
        DI <- k
        return (LH, DI, LSM, VSM, DSM, XSM)
    k <- k + 1

// If enumeration ends without finding CSM, the constraints are inconsistent
return FAIL
```

This specification makes the compressor and decompressor behavior deterministic and compatible by construction. The only
non-deterministic externality is wall-clock time in compression failure; the output is either produced with a correct DI
or not produced at all.

## 6. Apple Silicon Implementation Strategy (CPU and GPU)

### 6.1 Design Goals and Constraints

Apple Silicon systems provide high-performance ARM64 CPUs and integrated GPUs accessible through Metal. Metal is Apple's
low-overhead API supporting compute kernels, buffers, and command submission, with its programming model and shading
language specified in official documentation (Apple, n.d.-a; Apple, n.d.-b; Apple, n.d.-c). The implementation should
preserve determinism of enumeration and must interoperate exactly with the format's SHA-256 definition.

Given $s = 511$, the raw matrix is only $511^2 = 261{,}121$ bits ($\approx 32$ KiB). Thus, the challenge is not storage
but search control and propagation speed.

### 6.2 CPU-Centric Core for Determinism

Branching search is inherently irregular: different branches cause different propagation cascades, and backtracking
requires undo logs. Such control flow is typically better suited to CPUs than GPUs. On Apple Silicon, the CPU
implementation can store each row as a 512-bit aligned bitset (8 × 64-bit words) for fast operations, maintain a compact
unknown mask per row, keep per-line residuals $(u, a, \rho)$ in small arrays, and maintain an undo stack recording
assignments and line-stat deltas for fast rollback.

Row-hash checking can use a constant-time, single-block SHA-256 implementation specialized for 511-bit messages, since
the padded message occupies exactly one 512-bit block under FIPS 180-4 rules. This can reduce overhead relative to a
general streaming hash, while remaining standards-compliant (NIST, 2015).

### 6.3 Bulk Propagation Primitives on GPU

Although full DFS is ill-suited to GPU execution, specific subroutines can be accelerated on the GPU, particularly when
the solver occasionally needs to recompute global statistics from scratch (e.g., after many incremental steps) or
evaluate many similar operations over structured memory.

Metal supports general compute workloads using buffers and kernels (Apple, n.d.-b). The Metal Shading Language is a
C++-family language for writing kernels (Apple, n.d.-c). Two GPU-appropriate tasks are:

1. **Line-stat recomputation:**
   Given current assignment/unknown masks, compute $u(L)$ and $a(L)$ for all $4s$ lines in parallel, then derive
   $\rho(L)$. This is dominated by reductions and bit-counts, which map well to GPU SIMD execution.

2. **Forced-assignment detection:**
   For each line, test $\rho(L) = 0$ or $\rho(L) = u(L)$ and mark affected cells as forced. Because each line touches
   511 cells, naive marking can be bandwidth-heavy; however, GPU kernels can emit "force proposals" into a buffer, which
   the CPU can merge deterministically (e.g., sort by cell index, resolve conflicts, then apply in fixed order).

Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) provides optimized kernels and guidance for efficient GPU compute pipelines (Apple,
n.d.-d). While MPS is not a direct CSP solver, its existence supports a design that offloads well-structured compute to
the GPU while keeping the solver's control logic on the CPU.

### 6.4 Deterministic CPU--GPU Coordination

To preserve determinism, the CPU must remain the single source of truth for:

- the branching order,
- the assignment order,
- conflict detection,
- undo/redo logic.

GPU kernels should be used only to compute *pure functions* of the current state (e.g., recomputed counts) and return
results that the CPU applies in a strictly defined order. This avoids non-deterministic race effects.

A typical pattern is:

1. CPU performs incremental propagation for a bounded number of steps.
2. CPU dispatches a GPU "audit" kernel to recompute line stats and optionally propose forced assignments.
3. CPU verifies consistency with its incremental state (debug mode) or uses the recomputed stats (release mode) as
   authoritative, then continues DFS.

This division exploits Apple Silicon's GPU for throughput while ensuring reproducible enumeration.

### 6.5 Practical Engineering of the Row Hash

As defined in Section 2.3, each row is hashed as a 512-bit (64-byte) message formed by appending a fixed trailing zero
bit to the 511-bit row. This ensures byte alignment, eliminating the need for bit-precise message construction. The
format must still define bit order within bytes (MSB-first by convention) to guarantee interoperability across
implementations.

FIPS 180-4's padding procedure appends a single '1' bit, then zeros, then the 64-bit message length (NIST, 2015). For a
512-bit message, the padded result occupies exactly two 512-bit blocks (1024 bits total). Because the input is
byte-aligned, standard SHA-256 library functions can be used directly without custom bit-level padding logic. This
simplifies implementation and ensures that LH behaves as a stable, interoperable constraint.

## 7. Complexity, Correctness, and the Role of Time-Bounded Failure

### 7.1 Correctness Under the Model

If `Compress` returns a payload $\mathcal{C}'$, then by construction $\mathcal{C}$ matches the sums and row hashes
computed from the original $CSM$, and $DI$ is the position of $CSM$ in the canonical enumeration of feasible solutions.
Thus the decompressor returns exactly $CSM$ when it enumerates in the same canonical order. The scheme shifts the burden
of ambiguity resolution into the DI and makes decompression deterministic even when $\mathcal{C}$ admits multiple
feasible reconstructions.

### 7.2 Why a Single Time Tolerance Is Defensible

Because solution enumeration can be intrinsically expensive in combinatorial systems, a time-bounded failure mode is a
rational design choice. Complexity theory provides strong reasons to avoid promising polynomial-time enumeration in
general (Valiant, 1979). Likewise, the AllSAT literature emphasizes that enumerating solutions is a distinct problem
class with its own algorithmic challenges (Kobler et al., 2025).

By specifying one global parameter `max_compression_time`, the system avoids multiple interacting limits that are hard
to reason about, gives users a straightforward "works/doesn't work" operational contract, and makes performance tunable
to available hardware, including Apple Silicon.

### 7.3 Security Posture of the Hash Constraint

The LH vector is not used here as a cryptographic authentication mechanism; it is used as a *constraint* that ties each
row's bits to a digest. Nonetheless, its intended uniqueness relies on standard hash security properties, standardized
in FIPS 180-4 and discussed in NIST guidance (NIST, 2015; Dang, 2012). An adversary able to engineer row-level
second-preimages under the sum constraints could induce ambiguity, but the DI mechanism still guarantees deterministic
decoding. Therefore, the DI reduces the system's reliance on cryptographic uniqueness for *correctness* (though not for
performance).

## 8. Relationship to Belief Propagation and Hybrid Inference

Message-passing methods (BP, generalized BP) provide approximate marginal beliefs on factor graphs and are widely used
when exact inference is intractable (Kschischang et al., 2001; Yedidia et al., 2002; Wainwright & Jordan, 2008). In the
CRSCE setting, BP can serve as a *heuristic guide* for branching: prioritize cells with extreme beliefs, or prefer
assignments that maximize local consistency scores.

However, two constraints dominate the design:

1. **Hard feasibility:**
   Exact sums must be satisfied, so residual-based propagation and feasibility checks remain primary.

2. **Deterministic enumeration:**
   The canonical DI requires a fixed, spec-defined exploration order; any BP-guided branching must not change the
   enumeration order if the DI semantics depend on lex order.

A practical compromise is to keep the enumeration order lexicographic (to define the DI), but use BP only for
*non-semantic optimizations* such as early detection of contradictions, or as an auxiliary scoring function that affects
pruning decisions without changing the canonical traversal. This preserves the meaning of the DI while allowing
heuristic acceleration.

## 9. Implementation Standards

### 9.1 Object-Oriented Design Requirements

The CRSCE compressor and decompressor must be implemented using pure object-oriented programming (OOP) with
polymorphism. This requirement ensures that the codebase remains extensible, testable, and maintainable as the algorithm
evolves. Specifically, this requirement ensures that new compressors and decompression solvers can be added or removed
over time. Concrete components --- the constraint propagation engine, the branching strategy, the hash verification
layer, and the enumeration controller --- should each be encapsulated behind well-defined interfaces, allowing
alternative implementations to be substituted without modifying the solver's control logic.

### 9.2 Polymorphism as an Architectural Principle

Polymorphism is not merely a stylistic preference; it is a structural requirement motivated by the algorithm's design.
The solver operates over four families of cross-sum constraints (LSM, VSM, DSM, XSM) that differ in their indexing
geometry but share identical residual-tracking and forcing logic. A polymorphic line-constraint interface allows all
four families to be processed uniformly by the propagation engine, eliminating redundant code paths and reducing the
surface area for implementation errors.

Similarly, the hash verification layer should be abstracted behind a common interface. Although the current
specification uses SHA-256, the design discussed in Appendix B.1 (segmented prefix hashes) and potential future adoption
of alternative hash functions both argue for a pluggable hash interface. Polymorphism ensures that such changes can be
introduced without restructuring the solver.

### 9.3 Interface Boundaries

The implementation should define clear interface boundaries between at minimum the following components: the constraint
store (managing line statistics $u$, $a$, $\rho$ and cell assignments), the propagation engine (applying forcing rules
and detecting infeasibility), the branching controller (selecting the next unassigned cell and managing the undo stack),
the hash verifier (computing and comparing row digests), and the enumeration controller (coordinating DFS traversal and
yielding solutions in canonical order). Each component should be independently testable against its interface contract,
enabling unit-level verification of correctness properties that are difficult to assess at the system level.

### 9.4 Rationale for Pure OOP

Procedural or mixed-paradigm implementations tend to couple algorithmic logic with data representation, making it
difficult to substitute components or introduce optimizations without cascading changes. For CRSCE, where the solver
must maintain strict determinism across implementations (Section 7.1) and where GPU-accelerated alternatives may replace
CPU-bound components (Section 6), polymorphic dispatch provides the natural mechanism for swapping implementations while
preserving behavioral contracts. The pure OOP requirement also facilitates conformance testing: any compliant
implementation can be validated against the interface specifications independently of its internal strategy.

## 10. Object Design

Section 9 established the requirement for pure object-oriented design with polymorphism. This section specifies the
top-level architecture, entry points, and principal types for the CRSCE compressor and decompressor programs.

### 10.1 Entry Points

The compressor and decompressor are separate programs sharing a common library of core types and solver components. Each
program defines a single entry point:

- `compress(input_stream, output_stream) → FAIL`
  reads raw input, partitions it into fixed-size blocks, compresses each block independently, and writes the compressed
  payload stream. The per-block time limit `max_compression_time` is read from the `MAX_COMPRESSION_TIME` environment
  variable (Appendix A.4), defaulting to 1,800 seconds. If any block exceeds this limit, the entire operation fails.

- `decompress(input_stream, output_stream) → ERROR`
  reads a compressed payload stream, reconstructs each block by solving the constraint system to $S_{\text{DI}}$, and
  writes the recovered bitstream. Decompression is deterministic and unbounded in time; it either succeeds or reports a
  malformed payload.

### 10.2 Core Data Types

The following value types represent the fundamental data structures of the CRSCE format.

**`CSM`** encapsulates the $s \times s$ binary matrix. Internally, each row is stored as a 512-bit aligned bitset (8 ×
64-bit words), supporting fast bitwise operations, popcount, and row extraction. The matrix provides indexed access via
$(r, c)$ and row-major serialization via $\text{vec}(CSM)$.

```text
+--------------------------------------+
|                CSM                   |
+--------------------------------------+
| - rows: uint64[s][8]                 |
| - s: uint16                          |
+--------------------------------------+
| + CSM(s: uint16)                     |
| + get(r: uint16, c: uint16): bit     |
| + set(r: uint16, c: uint16, v: bit)  |
| + getRow(r: uint16): uint64[8]       |
| + vec(): bitstring                   |
| + popcount(r: uint16): uint16        |
+--------------------------------------+
```

**`CrossSumVector`** is an abstract base type representing an ordered sequence of integer sums. The constructor accepts
the number of elements (size). The base type defines `set(r, c, v)` to accumulate a cell's value into the appropriate
sum and `get(r, c)` to retrieve the current sum for the line containing cell $(r, c)$. Each concrete subtype determines
which index to use: `RowSum` (LSM) indexes by $r$ only, `ColumnSum` (VSM) indexes by $c$ only, `DiagonalSum` (DSM)
indexes by both $r$ and $c$ via $d = c - r + (s - 1)$, and `AntiDiagonalSum` (XSM) indexes by both via $x = r + c$. The
base type also defines `cells(r, c)` returning the set of $(r, c)$ indices participating in the same line as the given
cell, with each subtype resolving the line identity from $r$, $c$, or both as appropriate. Finally, `len(k)` returns the
number of cells on line $k$, and the encoding width per element is derived from `len(k)`.

```text
  +------------------------------------------------+
  |       <<abstract>> CrossSumVector              |
  +------------------------------------------------+
  | # sums: uint16[]                               |
  | # size: uint16                                 |
  +------------------------------------------------+
  | + CrossSumVector(size: uint16)                 |
  | + set(r: uint16, c: uint16, v: bit): void      |
  | + get(r: uint16, c: uint16): uint16            |
  | + cells(r: uint16, c: uint16): set<(r,c)>      |
  | + len(k: uint16): uint16                       |
  | # lineIndex(r: uint16, c: uint16): uint16      |
  +------------------------------------------------+
          ^        ^        ^                   ^
          |        |        |                   |
  +-------+--+ +---+----+ +-+-----------+ +-----+-------+
  | RowSum   | | ColSum | |   DiagSum   | | AntiDiagSum |
  | (LSM)    | | (VSM)  | |   (DSM)     | | (XSM)       |
  +----------+ +--------+ +-------------+ +-------------+
  | index: r | | index:c| | d=c-r+(s-1) | | x=r+c       |
  +----------+ +--------+ +-------------+ +-------------+
```

**`LateralHash`** stores the vector of $s$ SHA-256 digests, one per row. It provides `compute(row_r)` to hash a 512-bit
row message (511 data bits plus trailing zero) and `verify(r, digest)` to compare against the stored value.

```text
+----------------------------------------------+
|              LateralHash                     |
+----------------------------------------------+
| - digests: uint8[s][32]                      |
| - s: uint16                                  |
+----------------------------------------------+
| + LateralHash(s: uint16)                     |
| + compute(row: uint64[8]): uint8[32]         |
| + store(r: uint16, digest: uint8[32]): void  |
| + verify(r: uint16, digest: uint8[32]): bool |
| + getDigest(r: uint16): uint8[32]            |
+----------------------------------------------+
```

**`CompressedPayload`** represents $\mathcal{C}' = (\text{LH}, \text{DI}, \text{LSM}, \text{VSM}, \text{DSM},
\text{XSM})$ and provides serialization and deserialization methods that enforce the wire format byte-alignment
convention (Section 12.4): LH (byte-aligned), DI (uint8), followed by the bit-packed cross-sum vectors.

```text
+----------------------------------------------+
|           CompressedPayload                  |
+----------------------------------------------+
| - lh: LateralHash                           |
| - di: uint8                                  |
| - lsm: RowSum                               |
| - vsm: ColSum                               |
| - dsm: DiagSum                               |
| - xsm: AntiDiagSum                          |
+----------------------------------------------+
| + serialize(): bytestream                    |
| + deserialize(data: bytestream): void        |
| + getConstraintSet(): C                      |
| + getDI(): uint8                             |
+----------------------------------------------+
```

### 10.3 Solver Components

The solver architecture follows the interface boundaries defined in Section 9.3. Each component is an abstract interface
with one or more concrete implementations. The interfaces use several auxiliary types: `LineID` is an opaque identifier
for a specific line (row, column, diagonal, or anti-diagonal) within the constraint system; `CellState` is an
enumeration over `{UNASSIGNED, ZERO, ONE}`; `UndoToken` is an opaque handle returned by the branching controller to mark
a restore point on the undo stack; and `Assignment` is a record of `(r, c, value)` representing a single cell
assignment.

**`IConstraintStore`** manages the current partial assignment of the $s^2$ cells and the per-line statistics $(u, a,
\rho)$ for all $6s - 2$ lines. It is the single source of truth for the solver's state.

```text
+--------------------------------------------------+
|       <<interface>> IConstraintStore             |
+--------------------------------------------------+
| + assign(r: uint16, c: uint16, v: bit): void     |
| + unassign(r: uint16, c: uint16): void           |
| + getResidual(line: LineID): uint16              |
| + getUnknownCount(line: LineID): uint16          |
| + getAssignedCount(line: LineID): uint16         |
| + getLinesForCell(r: uint16, c: uint16): LineID[4]|
| + getCellState(r: uint16, c: uint16): CellState  |
+--------------------------------------------------+
```

**`IPropagationEngine`** applies forcing rules to a queue of affected lines until quiescence or infeasibility. When
$\rho(L) = 0$, it forces all unknowns on $L$ to 0; when $\rho(L) = u(L)$, it forces them to 1. It returns a boolean
indicating feasibility and records all forced assignments for undo purposes.

```text
+--------------------------------------------------+
|       <<interface>> IPropagationEngine           |
+--------------------------------------------------+
| + propagate(queue: LineID[]): bool               |
| + getForcedAssignments(): Assignment[]           |
| + reset(): void                                  |
+--------------------------------------------------+
```

**`IBranchingController`** selects the next unassigned cell in row-major order, manages the undo stack (save points,
rollback), and controls the branching order (0 before 1) to ensure canonical lexicographic enumeration.

```text
+--------------------------------------------------+
|       <<interface>> IBranchingController         |
+--------------------------------------------------+
| + nextCell(): (r: uint16, c: uint16) | null      |
| + saveUndoPoint(): UndoToken                     |
| + undoToSavePoint(token: UndoToken): void        |
| + branchOrder(): bit[]                           |
+--------------------------------------------------+
```

**`IHashVerifier`** abstracts the row-hash computation and comparison. The default implementation uses SHA-256 per FIPS
180-4 on 512-bit row messages. The interface admits alternative implementations (e.g., segmented prefix hashes per
Appendix B.1) without changing the solver's control flow.

```text
+--------------------------------------------------+
|       <<interface>> IHashVerifier                |
+--------------------------------------------------+
| + computeHash(row: uint64[8]): uint8[32]        |
| + verifyRow(r: uint16, row: uint64[8]): bool    |
| + setExpected(r: uint16, digest: uint8[32]): void|
+--------------------------------------------------+
```

**`IEnumerationController`** coordinates the DFS traversal by composing the constraint store, propagation engine,
branching controller, and hash verifier. It implements the `EnumerateSolutionsLex` generator (Algorithm 1), yielding
feasible solutions in canonical order. The compressor wraps this in a timed loop (Algorithm 3); the decompressor wraps
it in an indexed selection (Algorithm 2).

```text
+--------------------------------------------------+
|       <<interface>> IEnumerationController       |
+--------------------------------------------------+
| - store: IConstraintStore                        |
| - propagator: IPropagationEngine                 |
| - brancher: IBranchingController                 |
| - hasher: IHashVerifier                          |
+--------------------------------------------------+
| + enumerateSolutionsLex(): generator<CSM>        |
+--------------------------------------------------+
```

### 10.4 Compressor and Decompressor as Compositions

**`Compressor`** composes a `CSM`, a `CompressedPayload` builder, and an `IEnumerationController`. It computes the
cross-sum vectors and lateral hashes from the original matrix, then invokes the enumerator to discover the DI within the
time bound. On success, it assembles and serializes $\mathcal{C}'$.

```text
+--------------------------------------------------+
|                Compressor                        |
+--------------------------------------------------+
| - original: CSM                                  |
| - payload: CompressedPayload                     |
| - enumerator: IEnumerationController             |
+--------------------------------------------------+
| + Compressor(enumerator: IEnumerationController) |
| + compress(input: stream, output: stream): void  |
|            | FAIL                                 |
+--------------------------------------------------+
```

**`Decompressor`** composes a `CompressedPayload` parser and an `IEnumerationController`. It deserializes
$\mathcal{C}'$, reconstructs the constraint set $\mathcal{C}$, and invokes the enumerator to produce $S_{\text{DI}}$,
which it then deserializes into the recovered bitstream.

```text
+--------------------------------------------------+
|               Decompressor                       |
+--------------------------------------------------+
| - payload: CompressedPayload                     |
| - enumerator: IEnumerationController             |
+--------------------------------------------------+
| + Decompressor(enumerator: IEnumerationController)|
| + decompress(input: stream, output: stream): void|
|              | ERROR                              |
+--------------------------------------------------+
```

Both classes depend only on the abstract interfaces defined in Section 10.3, not on concrete implementations. This
ensures that the compressor and decompressor can be tested independently, and that alternative solver strategies (e.g.,
GPU-accelerated propagation per Section 6.3) can be injected without modifying the top-level control flow.

### 10.5 Observability (O11y)

Both the compressor and decompressor require structured observability to support debugging, performance analysis, and
operational monitoring. Rather than ad hoc logging scattered throughout the codebase, the design specifies a centralized
observability framework that records events asynchronously to a background thread, ensuring that instrumentation does
not block the solver's critical path.

**`TagValue`** is a discriminated union representing a single tag value. The supported types are: `string`, `bool`,
`int`, `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`, `uint`, `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, `uint64`, `single`, and `double`. This
range covers all scalar types needed to describe solver state, performance counters, and diagnostic metadata without
resorting to string serialization of numeric values.

```text
+----------------------------------------------+
|              TagValue                        |
+----------------------------------------------+
| - type: enum { STRING, BOOL, INT, INT8,      |
|   INT16, INT32, INT64, UINT, UINT8, UINT16,  |
|   UINT32, UINT64, SINGLE, DOUBLE }           |
| - value: <union of above types>              |
+----------------------------------------------+
| + TagValue(v: string)                        |
| + TagValue(v: bool)                          |
| + TagValue(v: int64)                         |
| + TagValue(v: uint64)                        |
| + TagValue(v: double)                        |
| + ... (overloads for each supported type)    |
| + getType(): enum                            |
| + as<T>(): T                                 |
+----------------------------------------------+
```

**`Tag`** is a key-value pair where the key is a string and the value is a `TagValue`.

```text
+----------------------------------------------+
|                  Tag                         |
+----------------------------------------------+
| - key: string                                |
| - value: TagValue                            |
+----------------------------------------------+
| + Tag(key: string, value: TagValue)          |
| + getKey(): string                           |
| + getValue(): TagValue                       |
+----------------------------------------------+
```

**`Event`** is a structured, timestamped, tagged record. The timestamp is captured at the moment `event()` is called,
before the record is dispatched to the background thread. This guarantees that event timestamps reflect the caller's
wall-clock time, not the processing thread's dequeue time.

```text
+----------------------------------------------+
|                 Event                        |
+----------------------------------------------+
| - timestamp: uint64 (nanoseconds)            |
| - eventName: string                          |
| - tags: Tag[]                                |
+----------------------------------------------+
| + Event(name: string, tags: Tag[])           |
| + getTimestamp(): uint64                     |
| + getEventName(): string                     |
| + getTags(): Tag[]                           |
+----------------------------------------------+
```

**`IO11y`** is the observability interface. It provides `event()` for recording structured events and `counter()` for
incrementing named counters. The `event()` method captures the current timestamp, constructs an `Event` record, and
dispatches it asynchronously to a background processing thread. The `counter()` method accepts a counter name and
asynchronously passes it to the background thread, where a `map<string, int64>` maintains the running totals; each call
increments the named counter by one. The background thread is responsible for serialization, filtering, and output
(e.g., structured JSON to a log sink, metrics aggregation, or trace export). All formatting and routing decisions are
deferred to the background processor, keeping the caller's instrumentation to a single non-blocking call per event or
counter increment.

```text
+----------------------------------------------+
|         <<interface>> IO11y                  |
+----------------------------------------------+
| + event(name: string, tags: Tag[]): void     |
| + counter(name: string): void                |
| + flush(): void                              |
| + shutdown(): void                           |
+----------------------------------------------+
```

The `flush()` method blocks until all queued events and pending counter increments have been processed, and `shutdown()`
drains the queue and terminates the background thread. These are intended for use at program exit or during testing, not
during normal solver operation. Counter values can be retrieved after `flush()` for reporting or exported as tagged
events by the background processor.

**Initialization and lifecycle.** When either the compressor or decompressor program starts, it initializes the O11y
background thread before any solver work begins. The initialization generates a UUID `run_id` that uniquely identifies
the current execution. Every event and counter record produced during that execution is tagged with this `run_id`,
enabling downstream tools to segment, filter, and correlate observability data by individual runs.

The background thread writes to the file specified by the `OBSERVABILITY_LOG_FILE` environment variable. If the variable
is not set, the default path is `./log/<program_name>.log`, where `<program_name>` is `compress` or `decompress` as
appropriate. The log directory is created if it does not exist. The file is opened in append-only mode, ensuring that
records from prior runs are never overwritten and that concurrent or sequential executions accumulate a complete audit
trail. Each record is written as a single JSON object followed by a newline (JSON-L format). Event records contain the
fields `run_id`, `timestamp`, `type: "event"`, `event_name`, and `tags` (an object of key-value pairs). Counter records
contain `run_id`, `timestamp`, `type: "counter"`, `counter_name`, and `value` (the current int64 total). No record is
ever modified or deleted after being written.

The background thread runs for the lifetime of the program and periodically flushes queued events and pending counter
snapshots to disk on a configurable interval. The flush interval is determined by the `OBSERVABILITY_FLUSH_INTERVAL`
environment variable (Appendix A.4), which specifies the period in milliseconds. If the variable is not set, the default
interval is 1,000 ms. Between periodic flushes, the background thread processes enqueued messages as they arrive; the
periodic flush ensures that even during idle periods, any buffered records are written to disk within a bounded time
window. At program termination, `shutdown()` is called to drain the queue, execute a final flush, and close the log
file. If the program terminates abnormally, any records already flushed remain available in the log file for post-mortem
analysis.

```text
+----------------------------------------------+
|              O11yBackgroundThread             |
+----------------------------------------------+
| - runId: UUID                                |
| - logFile: file_handle                       |
| - queue: concurrent_queue<O11yMessage>       |
| - counters: map<string, int64>               |
| - programName: string                        |
| - flushIntervalMs: uint32                    |
+----------------------------------------------+
| + O11yBackgroundThread(programName: string)  |
| + getRunId(): UUID                           |
| + enqueue(msg: O11yMessage): void            |
| + run(): void                                |
| + drain(): void                              |
+----------------------------------------------+
```

The `O11yBackgroundThread` is an implementation detail, not part of the public `IO11y` interface. Callers interact only
with `IO11y`; the background thread is created and managed by the concrete `IO11y` implementation provided at program
startup.

All solver components (Section 10.3) and the top-level `Compressor` and `Decompressor` classes (Section 10.4) accept an
`IO11y` instance via constructor injection. This allows observability to be disabled entirely (via a no-op
implementation) for benchmarking, or redirected to different sinks for testing and production without modifying any
solver logic.

### 10.6 Argument Parser

Both binaries delegate argument parsing to a shared `ArgParser` class (Section 11.3, `common/ArgParser/`). The parser
processes command-line tokens left-to-right, recognizing `-in`, `-out`, `-h`, and `--help`. Unknown flags or a missing
value after `-in` or `-out` produce a parse error. Filesystem validation occurs after parsing: the input path is checked
for existence via `stat()`, and the output path is checked for non-existence. Failures raise typed exceptions
(`CliInputMissing`, `CliOutputExists`, `CliParseError`, `CliHelpRequested`, `CliNoArgs`) that the binary's `main()` maps
to the appropriate exit code and error message (Appendix A.3).

**`Options`** is a value type holding the parsed result of command-line arguments.

```text
+----------------------------------------------+
|                 Options                      |
+----------------------------------------------+
| + input: string                              |
| + output: string                             |
| + help: bool                                 |
+----------------------------------------------+
```

**`ArgParser`** encapsulates token-by-token parsing and filesystem validation. The two-argument constructor parses
immediately and throws on any error condition; the one-argument constructor defers parsing to an explicit `parse()`
call.

```text
+--------------------------------------------------+
|                  ArgParser                       |
+--------------------------------------------------+
| - programName: string                            |
| - opts: Options                                  |
+--------------------------------------------------+
| + ArgParser(programName: string)                 |
| + ArgParser(programName: string,                 |
|             args: span<char*>)                   |
| + parse(args: span<char*>): bool                 |
| + options(): const Options&                      |
| + usage(): string                                |
+--------------------------------------------------+
```

The `parse()` method returns `true` if the arguments are valid or the help flag is set, and `false` on unknown flags or
missing values. The two-argument constructor additionally validates the filesystem state and throws one of five typed
exceptions: `CliNoArgs` (no arguments provided), `CliHelpRequested` (help flag present), `CliParseError` (unknown flag
or missing value), `CliInputMissing` (input file does not exist), or `CliOutputExists` (output file already exists). All
five inherit from `CrsceException`.

## 11. Project Structure and Standards

The CRSCE implementation is organized as a C++23 CMake project targeting Apple Silicon. The directory layout separates
binary entry points, core implementation, public headers, tests, and build infrastructure into distinct top-level
directories. This section documents the canonical project structure to which all implementations must conform.

### 11.1 Top-Level Layout

```text
crsce/
├── cmd/                  Binary entrypoints
├── src/                  Core implementation
├── include/              Public headers (mirrors src/)
├── test/                 CTest suites
├── cmake/                Build system
│   ├── root.cmake        Root CMake orchestration
│   ├── pipeline/         Build/lint/test/cover stages
│   └── projects/         Per-binary CMake files
├── tools/                Standalone utilities and scripts
├── Makefile              Developer workflow targets
├── Makefile.d/           Makefile includes
├── CMakeLists.txt        Root CMake configuration
└── CMakePresets.json     Preset definitions
```

### 11.2 Binary Entrypoints (`cmd/`)

Each subdirectory under `cmd/` contains a `main.cpp` that instantiates the top-level class (Section 10.4) and wires
together the concrete implementations of the solver interfaces (Section 10.3). The two primary binaries are `compress`
and `decompress`. Additional utilities support testing and diagnostics.

```text
cmd/
├── compress/             Compression binary
├── decompress/           Decompression binary
├── hasher/               Standalone hashing utility
├── binDumper/            Binary dump inspector
├── testRunnerZeroes/     Test runner: all-zeros patterns
├── testRunnerOnes/       Test runner: all-ones patterns
├── testRunnerRandom/     Test runner: random patterns
├── testRunnerAlternating01/  Test runner: alternating 0/1
└── testRunnerAlternating10/  Test runner: alternating 1/0
```

### 11.3 Core Implementation (`src/`)

The `src/` directory is partitioned into three modules: `Compress/`, `Decompress/`, and `common/`. Each module maps
directly to the object design in Section 10.

```text
src/
├── Compress/             Compression pipeline
│   └── Cli/              Compress CLI handling
├── Decompress/           Decompression pipeline
│   ├── Cli/              Decompress CLI handling
│   ├── Decompressor/     Main decompressor orchestration
│   ├── Solvers/          Solver wrappers and selection
└── common/               Shared modules
    ├── ArgParser/         Command-line argument parsing
    ├── BitHashBuffer/     Bit buffer with hashing
    ├── Cli/               Common CLI utilities
    ├── Csm/               CSM matrix
    ├── CrossSum/          Cross-sum data structures
    ├── FileBitSerializer/ Bit-level file I/O
    ├── Format/            Format serialization
    │   └── CompressedPayload/ Compressed block payload (Section 10.2)
    ├── HasherUtils/       Hashing utilities
    ├── LateralHash/       Lateral hash data structures
    ├── O11y/              Observability (Section 10.5)
    ├── RowHashVerifier/   SHA-256 row hash verification
    ├── Util/              General utilities
    └── exceptions/        Exception definitions
```

### 11.4 Public Headers (`include/`)

The `include/` directory mirrors the `src/` structure exactly. Each class or interface defined in `src/` has a
corresponding header in `include/` under the same relative path. This separation enforces a clean distinction between
public API and private implementation, and allows dependent modules to include headers without exposing implementation
details.

```text
include/
├── Compress/             Compression pipeline headers
│   └── Cli/              Compress CLI handling headers
├── Decompress/           Decompression pipeline headers
│   ├── Cli/              Decompress CLI handling headers
│   ├── Decompressor/     Main decompressor orchestration headers
│   ├── Solvers/          Solver wrappers and selection headers
└── common/               Shared modules headers
    ├── ArgParser/         Command-line argument parsing headers
    ├── BitHashBuffer/     Bit buffer with hashing headers
    ├── Cli/               Common CLI utilities headers
    ├── Csm/               CSM matrix headers
    ├── CrossSum/          Cross-sum data structures headers
    ├── FileBitSerializer/ Bit-level file I/O headers
    ├── Format/            Format serialization headers
    │   └── CompressedPayload/ Compressed block payload headers
    ├── HasherUtils/       Hashing utilities headers
    ├── LateralHash/       Lateral hash data structures headers
    ├── O11y/              Observability (Section 10.5) headers
    ├── RowHashVerifier/   SHA-256 row hash verification headers
    ├── Util/              General utilities headers
    └── exceptions/        Exception definitions headers
```

### 11.5 Test Suites (`test/`)

Tests are organized by module and granularity. Each test file defines exactly one test function, registered in
`test/CMakeLists.txt`. Tests require both happy-path and failure-path coverage, and the project enforces a minimum of
95% line coverage via `make cover`.

```text
test/
├── Compress/             Compression pipeline tests
│   └── Cli/              Compress CLI handling tests
├── Decompress/           Decompression pipeline tests
│   ├── Cli/              Decompress CLI handling tests
│   ├── Decompressor/     Main decompressor orchestration tests
│   ├── Solvers/          Solver wrappers and selection tests
└── common/               Shared modules tests
    ├── ArgParser/         Command-line argument parsing tests
    ├── BitHashBuffer/     Bit buffer with hashing tests
    ├── Cli/               Common CLI utilities tests
    ├── Csm/               CSM matrix tests
    ├── CrossSum/          Cross-sum data structures tests
    ├── FileBitSerializer/ Bit-level file I/O tests
    ├── Format/            Format serialization tests
    │   └── CompressedPayload/ Compressed block payload tests
    ├── HasherUtils/       Hashing utilities tests
    ├── Helpers/           Helper functions for tests
    ├── LateralHash/       Lateral hash data structures tests
    ├── O11y/              Observability (Section 10.5) tests
    ├── RowHashVerifier/   SHA-256 row hash verification tests
    ├── Util/              General utilities tests
    └── exceptions/        Exception definitions tests
```

Test files are preceded with `unit_`, `integration_` and `e2e_`

### 11.6 Build System (`cmake/`)

The build system uses CMake with Ninja generator and C++23.

Presets are defined in `CMakePresets.json` and include `llvm-debug`, `llvm-release`, `arm64-debug`, `arm64-release`.

The Makefile auto-selects `llvm-debug` when Homebrew LLVM is available, otherwise `cmake-build-debug`.

The `cmake/pipeline/` directory contains modular build stages (build, clean, configure, lint, test, cover), and
`cmake/projects/` contains one CMake file per binary target.

The CMake implementation should remain modular using `*.cmake` files to keep the code DRY and readable.

There is a `Makefile` and smaller `Makefile.d/*.mk` files which provide a thin wrapper around CMake.  Any `make` target
should call CMake, where the majority of logic should be expressed.

```bash
make ready           # verify toolchain prerequisites
make ready/fix       # install missing prerequisites (Homebrew, LLVM, Python venv, Node)
make clean           # delete and recreate build/
make configure       # configure CMake (default preset: llvm-debug)
make build           # build all presets (auto-configures each)
make build/one       # build only PRESET (e.g., make build/one PRESET=llvm-debug)
make lint            # run all linters (md, sh, py, cpp/cppcheck + clang-tidy)
make test            # run CTest suite for PRESET
make cover           # enforce >=95% line coverage
make test/zeroes            # all-zeros input patterns
make test/ones              # all-ones input patterns
make test/random            # random input patterns
make test/alternating01     # alternating 0/1 patterns
make test/alternating10     # alternating 1/0 patterns
```

### 11.7 Coding Conventions

All source files use C++23, spaces only (no tabs), and a 120-column soft wrap. Every file requires a Doxygen-style
header:

```cpp
/**
 * @file <filename>
 * @copyright (c) 2026 Sam Caldwell. See LICENSE.txt.
 */
```

All Classes, Types, Functions, Methods and TEST(...) declarations and definitions are immediately preceded by a
Doxygen-style header:

```cpp
/**
 * @name myfunc
 * @brief example function
 * @param argc Argument count.
 * @param argv Argument vector.
 * @return Process exit code (0 on success, non-zero represents an error state).
 */
```

Class properties should be immediately preceded by a Doxygen-style header:

```cpp
/**
 * @name propName
 * @brief property description
 */
```

For any function or method which throws an exception, the Doxygen-style header should provide `@throws <exception>` as
well.

The following general rules apply to the entire project (and are enforced by the linter):

1. Entities are declared in .h files and defined in .cpp files.
2. Only one entity declared per .h file
3. Only one entity defined per .cpp file
4. Each test file defines exactly one test function.
5. The project enforces linting via `make lint` (Markdown, shell, Python, C++ via cppcheck and clang-tidy).
6. Test coverage is enforced via `make cover` at a 95% minimum threshold.

The following requirements apply to all exception usage in the project:

1. Every exception thrown must be a `CrsceException` subtype; no raw `std::runtime_error`, `std::logic_error`, or other
   standard library exceptions may be thrown directly.
2. Each exception class occupies its own header file under `common/exceptions/`, following the one-entity-per-file
   convention (Section 11.7).
3. Exception classes follow the Rule of Zero, relying on `std::runtime_error` for copy/move semantics.
4. Every function or method that throws must document the exception in its Doxygen header using `@throws` (Section
   11.7).
5. Exception messages must be descriptive and include contextual information (e.g., the offending file path for
   `CliInputMissing`).
6. Avoid recursion unless using tail-call recursion.
7. Where feasible, asynchronous lambda functions using coroutines should be applied to improve performance.

### 11.8 Exceptions

The project must not use generic exceptions such as `std::runtime_error()` directly. Instead, the project defines a
single base exception class, `CrsceException`, which inherits from `std::runtime_error`, and all application-specific
exceptions derive from it. This enables callers to catch `CrsceException` for uniform handling or catch a specific
derived type for targeted recovery. All exception classes are header-only and reside in `common/exceptions/` (Sections
11.3--11.5).

```text
std::runtime_error
└── CrsceException
    ├── CliNoArgs                      No CLI arguments provided
    ├── CliHelpRequested               Help flag (-h/--help) detected
    ├── CliParseError                  Unknown flag or missing value
    ├── CliInputMissing                Input file does not exist
    ├── CliOutputExists                Output file already exists
    ├── CompressTimeoutException       Compression exceeded time limit
    ├── CompressNonZeroExitException   Compress subprocess non-zero exit
    ├── DecompressTimeoutException     Decompression exceeded time limit
    ├── DecompressNonZeroExitException Decompress subprocess non-zero exit
    └── PossibleCollisionException     Decompressed output hash mismatch
```

## 12. File Format Specification

This section specifies the on-disk layout for CRSCE v1 files. A CRSCE file consists of a single file header followed by
one or more compressed blocks. All multi-byte integer fields are little-endian unless otherwise noted. The format is
designed so that two independent implementations producing the same compressed output from the same input will generate
byte-identical files.

### 12.1 File Header

The file header is exactly 28 bytes and contains the metadata needed to parse and validate the remainder of the file.

```text
Offset  Size     Type     Field                    Description
------  -------  -------  -----------------------  ------------------------------------
 0       4       char[4]  magic                    ASCII "CRSC" (0x43 0x52 0x53 0x43)
 4       2       uint16   version                  Format version (1)
 6       2       uint16   header_bytes             Header size in bytes (28)
 8       8       uint64   original_file_size_bytes Original uncompressed file size

24       4       uint32   header_crc32             IEEE CRC-32 over bytes 0--23
```

The `header_crc32` field provides integrity verification for the header itself. A decoder must reject any file whose
CRC-32 does not match the computed value over the first 24 bytes.

### 12.2 Block Count and Last-Block Padding

Each block encodes exactly one $511 \times 511$ CSM derived from input bits. The number of blocks is determined by the
original file size:

$$
    \text{block\_count} = \left\lceil \frac{\text{original\_file\_size\_bytes} \times 8}{s^2} \right\rceil
$$

where $s = 511$ and $s^2 = 261{,}121$ bits per block. If the input bitstream does not fill the final block, the
remaining cells are zero-padded to produce a full $s \times s$ matrix. All 511 rows of the final block still generate LH
digests (hashing the zero-padded rows). During decompression, the `original_file_size_bytes` field determines how many
bits of the final block's reconstructed CSM contribute to the output; trailing zero-padded bits are discarded.

### 12.3 Bit Serialization Order

Input bytes are expanded to bits MSB-first: bit 7 of each byte is emitted first, bit 0 last. These bits fill the CSM in
row-major order, left-to-right within each row, top-to-bottom across rows. During decompression, the inverse mapping
applies: reconstructed CSM bits are packed MSB-first into output bytes.

Each row of the CSM contains $s = 511$ data bits. For hashing purposes, a fixed trailing zero bit is appended to form a
512-bit (64-byte) message, as defined in Section 2.3. This padding bit is not stored in the block payload; it is
implicit in the format.

### 12.4 Block Payload Layout

Each block payload is a fixed-length byte-aligned bitstream. The matrix dimension $s = 511$ is a format constant and is
not stored per block. The fields appear in the following order, matching the wire format tuple $\mathcal{C}' =
(\text{LH}, \text{DI}, \text{LSM}, \text{VSM}, \text{DSM}, \text{XSM})$ defined in Section 4.2.

```text
Field   Elements    Bits/Element   Total Bits   Total Bytes   Encoding
------  ----------  ------------   ----------   -----------   --------
LH      511         256            130,816      16,352        32 bytes per digest, sequential
DI      1           8              8            1             uint8
LSM     511         9              4,599        ---           MSB-first packed bitstream
VSM     511         9              4,599        ---           MSB-first packed bitstream
DSM     2s-1=1,021  variable       8,185        ---           MSB-first, ceil(log2(len(d)+1))
XSM     2s-1=1,021  variable       8,185        ---           MSB-first, ceil(log2(len(x)+1))
------  ----------  ------------   ----------   -----------   --------
Total                              156,392      19,549
```

The total block payload is $156{,}392$ bits ($19{,}549$ bytes). The payload is naturally byte-aligned, so no trailing
padding bits are required. The total compressed file size is therefore $28 + (\text{block\_count} \times 19{,}549)$
bytes.

**LH (Lateral Hash).** The 511 SHA-256 digests are stored sequentially, each as 32 bytes, for a total of 16,352 bytes.
LH[0] corresponds to row 0, LH[510] to row 510.

**DI (Disambiguation Index).** An 8-bit unsigned integer selecting the intended solution from the canonical enumeration
(Section 4.2). Values 0--255 are valid; if the original matrix's position exceeds 255, compression fails.

**LSM and VSM (Row and Column Sums).** Each vector contains $s = 511$ elements. Each element requires $b = \lceil
\log_2(s + 1) \rceil = 9$ bits and is serialized MSB-first into a packed bitstream. The $511 \times 9 = 4{,}599$ bits
per vector are packed continuously; the final partial byte (if any) is zero-padded to the byte boundary only at the end
of the entire cross-sum region, not between individual vectors.

**DSM and XSM (Diagonal and Anti-Diagonal Sums).** Each vector contains $2s - 1 = 1{,}021$ elements corresponding to
straight (non-wrapping) diagonals. Element $k$ requires $\lceil \log_2(\text{len}(k) + 1) \rceil$ bits, where
$\text{len}(k) = \min(k + 1,\; s,\; 2s - 1 - k)$ as defined in Section 2.2. Elements are serialized MSB-first in index
order ($k = 0, 1, \ldots, 2s - 2$), packed continuously into the bitstream.

### 12.5 Cross-Sum Ranges and Validation

Each LSM and VSM entry must be in the range $[0, s]$ where $s = 511$. Each DSM entry at index $d$ must be in $[0,
\text{len}(d)]$, and each XSM entry at index $x$ must be in $[0, \text{len}(x)]$. A decoder should reject any block
containing out-of-range cross-sum values.

### 12.6 Block Acceptance Criteria

A block is accepted if and only if the reconstructed CSM simultaneously satisfies both conditions: it reproduces the
stored LSM, VSM, DSM, and XSM vectors exactly for all indices, and it recomputes per-row LH from the reconstructed rows
exactly ($\text{digest} = \text{SHA-256}(\text{row}_{64})$) for all $r \in \{0, \ldots, 510\}$. Any mismatch results in
rejection of that block. Decoders must fail hard by default and must not produce partial output.

### 12.7 File Size Validation

A decoder can validate file integrity before parsing blocks by checking:

$$
    \text{file\_size} = 28 + (\text{block\_count} \times 19{,}549)
$$

where `block_count` is read from the header. Any deviation indicates a truncated or corrupted file.

## 13. Conclusion

This paper formalized a disambiguated CRSCE decompression process that remains deterministic even if the base constraint
set admits multiple feasible reconstructions. The key idea is *canonical solution indexing*: define a strict
lexicographic order on feasible matrices, encode the zero-based DI of the intended solution as $S_{\text{DI}}$, and
discover that DI at compression time by running the decompressor as an enumerator constrained by the known original
matrix. The compressed payload $\mathcal{C}' = (\text{LH}, \text{DI}, \text{LSM}, \text{VSM}, \text{DSM}, \text{XSM})$
is ordered for byte-alignment efficiency, with all fixed-width fields preceding the bit-packed cross-sum vectors.
Because enumeration can be expensive, the design includes exactly one tolerance parameter --- `max_compression_time` ---
beyond which compression fails, requiring a fallback to another algorithm.

We established that the probability of a non-unique reconstruction is approximately $10^{-40{,}199}$ under a
random-oracle model, combining the cross-sum collision barrier ($\sim 10^{-819}$) with the per-row SHA-256 collision
barrier ($\sim 10^{-39{,}380}$). Each row is hashed as a byte-aligned 512-bit message (the 511-bit row plus a fixed
trailing zero bit), simplifying implementation while preserving compliance with FIPS 180-4 (NIST, 2015).

We moved from theory to implementation by presenting a deterministic enumerator based on incremental feasibility
propagation for cardinality constraints, row-hash verification, and canonical branching to preserve lexicographic order.
For Apple Silicon, we argued for CPU-centric control flow with optional GPU acceleration for bulk recomputation tasks
using Metal, maintaining strict determinism by keeping all state changes and ordering decisions on the CPU.

The implementation is specified as pure object-oriented with polymorphism, ensuring that the constraint propagation
engine, hash verification layer, branching strategy, and enumeration controller are each encapsulated behind
well-defined interfaces. This architectural requirement supports extensibility, conformance testing, and the
substitution of alternative implementations --- including GPU-accelerated components --- without compromising the
determinism guarantees on which the DI mechanism depends.

## Appendix A. Command-Line Usage

The CRSCE project produces two primary binaries, `compress` and `decompress`, which share a common argument parser and
follow identical conventions for flags, validation, and exit codes.

### A.1 Compress

```text
usage: compress -in <file> -out <file>
```

The `compress` binary reads an uncompressed input file, partitions it into $511 \times 511$-bit blocks, compresses each
block independently per the format defined in Section 12, and writes the compressed output. If any block exceeds
`max_compression_time`, the entire operation fails and no output is produced.

**Flags:**

- `-in <path>` — Path to the input file (required). The file must exist.
- `-out <path>` — Path to the output file (required). The file must not already exist.
- `-h` or `--help` — Display usage information and exit.

### A.2 Decompress

```text
usage: decompress -in <file> -out <file>
```

The `decompress` binary reads a CRSCE-compressed file, reconstructs each block by solving the constraint system to
$S_{\text{DI}}$ (Section 5.5), and writes the recovered bitstream. Decompression is deterministic and unbounded in time;
it either succeeds or reports a malformed payload.

**Flags:**

- `-in <path>` — Path to the compressed input file (required). The file must exist.
- `-out <path>` — Path to the output file (required). The file must not already exist.
- `-h` or `--help` — Display usage information and exit.

### A.3 Exit Codes

Both binaries use the same exit code conventions.

| Code | Meaning                                                               |
|----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|0     |Success, or help displayed, or no arguments provided                   |
|2     |Parse error (unknown flag or missing value for -in/-out)               |
|3     |Filesystem validation error (input file missing or output file exists) |

When no arguments are provided, `compress` prints `"crsce-compress: ready"` to standard output and exits with code 0.
When `-h` or `--help` is present, both binaries print the usage string to standard output and exit with code 0. Parse
errors and filesystem validation errors are printed to standard error.

### A.4 Environment Variables

Both binaries recognize the following environment variables.

```text
Variable                      Default                      Description
----------------------------  ---------------------------  ----------------------------------
MAX_COMPRESSION_TIME          1800                         Max compression time per block (s)
OBSERVABILITY_LOG_FILE        ./log/<program_name>.log     Path to the append-only JSON-L log
OBSERVABILITY_FLUSH_INTERVAL  1000                         Periodic flush interval (ms)
```

The `MAX_COMPRESSION_TIME` variable specifies the wall-clock time limit, in seconds, for compressing a single block
including DI discovery (Section 4.4). If the variable is not set, the default is 1,800 seconds (30 minutes). If the
compressor exceeds this limit on any block, the entire operation fails and no output is produced. This variable is
recognized only by the `compress` binary; the `decompress` binary ignores it, as decompression is unbounded in time by
design (Section 10.1).

The `OBSERVABILITY_LOG_FILE` variable specifies the file to which the O11y background thread (Section 10.5) writes event
and counter records. If the variable is not set, the default path is `./log/compress.log` or `./log/decompress.log` as
appropriate. The log directory is created if it does not exist. The file is opened in append-only mode, ensuring that
records from prior runs are never overwritten.

The `OBSERVABILITY_FLUSH_INTERVAL` variable specifies the period, in milliseconds, at which the O11y background thread
flushes buffered events and counter snapshots to disk. If the variable is not set, the default interval is 1,000 ms.
Setting a shorter interval improves observability latency at the cost of more frequent I/O; setting a longer interval
reduces I/O overhead during high-throughput solver phases.

## Appendix B. Ideas Under Consideration

### B.1 Segmented Prefix Hashes for Early Solver Pruning

The current design stores a single full-row SHA-256 digest per row, which can only be verified once all $s = 511$ bits
of that row are assigned. This means the solver may pursue a doomed branch for hundreds of assignments before
discovering a hash mismatch at the end of the row.

A segmented prefix hash scheme would replace the single full-row digest with multiple shorter digests computed over
progressively longer prefixes of each row. For example, four prefix checkpoints at bit positions 128, 256, 384, and 511
would allow the solver to verify partial row assignments as each prefix is completed during left-to-right cell
assignment. A mismatch at the first checkpoint (128 bits) would prune the branch before assigning the remaining 383
bits, potentially eliminating a vast subtree of the search space.

The storage budget is comparable to shorter full-row hashes. Four 32-bit prefix digests per row cost $4 \times 32 \times
511 = 65{,}408$ bits --- the same as a single 128-bit full-row hash and half the current SHA-256 cost. The
per-checkpoint collision resistance of $2^{-32}$ is low in isolation but sufficient in context: the solver is checking a
single candidate prefix against a single stored digest among rows already constrained by four cross-sum families, and
any false positive at an early checkpoint is caught by subsequent checkpoints or the final digest.

The prefix digests need not use a cryptographic hash. A fast non-cryptographic function (e.g., xxHash3) would suffice
for the intermediate checkpoints, with the final full-row checkpoint using truncated SHA-256 for the stronger uniqueness
guarantee. This hybrid approach would preserve the FIPS 180-4 standardization narrative for the final constraint while
accelerating solver pruning at intermediate stages.

This idea remains under evaluation. The key open questions are: (a) the optimal number and placement of checkpoints
given the solver's row-major assignment order, (b) the interaction between prefix hash pruning and
constraint-propagation-driven forced assignments (which may complete row segments out of left-to-right order), and (c)
the impact on $C_r$ under various checkpoint/digest-size configurations.

### B.2 Auxiliary Cross-Sum Partitions as Solver Accelerators

The lateral hash vector (LH) provides cryptographic collision resistance at a cost of $256s = 130{,}816$ bits per block.
While no finite number of additional cross-sum partitions can replicate the nonlinear collision resistance of SHA-256
(see Section 3.3), auxiliary partitions may nevertheless improve decompression performance by increasing the density of
constraint-propagation forcing opportunities, potentially reducing solver runtime to meet a sub-second wall-clock
budget.

**Information-theoretic limitations.** A cross-sum partition of $s$ groups of $s$ cells contributes at most
$s \lceil \log_2(s+1) \rceil = 4{,}599$ bits of constraint information. The LH budget of 130,816 bits accommodates at
most $\lfloor 130{,}816 / 4{,}599 \rfloor = 28$ such partitions. Even 28 partitions yield a total signature of
approximately 30,167 bits --- far short of the $s^2 = 261{,}121$ bits needed to uniquely determine the matrix. The
expected collision class size with all 28 partitions (and no LH) remains $2^{230{,}954}$, making sum-only
reconstruction without hashes infeasible. To quantify the collision probability precisely: the signature space of all
cross-sum partitions combined (the four original families plus 28 auxiliary) has at most $2^{30{,}167}$ distinct values,
while the matrix space has $2^{261{,}121}$ elements. By the pigeonhole principle, the probability that a uniformly
random matrix is the unique preimage of its signature is at most $2^{30{,}167} / 2^{261{,}121} = 2^{-230{,}954}$, so

$$
    P(\text{collision} \mid 28 \text{ auxiliary partitions, no LH}) \geq 1 - 2^{-230{,}954}
    \approx 1 - 10^{-69{,}541} = 0.\underbrace{99\ldots9}_{69{,}541 \text{ nines}}.
$$

Collision is a virtual certainty with this limited view.  See the caveat, below. The actual collision probability
is almost certainly lower due to the construction of cross sum vectors. Nonetheless, for comparison, the current
design with four partitions and LH achieves
$P(\text{collision}) \leq 2^{-256s} = 2^{-130{,}816} \approx 10^{-39{,}380}$
under the SHA-256 random-oracle model (Section 3.3). The gap between the two regimes is qualitative, not merely
quantitative: cross-sum constraints are linear functionals over $\mathbb{Z}$, so the set of indistinguishable
matrices forms a coset of a lattice in
$\mathbb{Z}^{s^2}$ with kernel dimension at least $s^2 - (7s - 6) \approx 257{,}550$ even after all partitions are
included. SHA-256, by contrast, is a nonlinear pseudorandom function with no exploitable algebraic kernel. No number
of additional linear sum partitions can close this gap.

The following table summarizes the collision probability under three configurations:

| Configuration               | Information (bits) | Collision class size | $P(\text{collision})$            |
|-----------------------------|--------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| 4 partitions only           | 25,568             | $2^{235{,}553}$      | $1 - 10^{-70{,}926}$             |
| 4 partitions + 28 auxiliary | 30,167             | $2^{230{,}954}$      | $1 - 10^{-69{,}541}$             |
| 4 partitions + LH (current) | 156,384            | $\leq 2^{-256}$ (cryptographic) | $\leq 10^{-39{,}380}$ |

**Interlocking geometry and minimum swap size.** The pigeonhole and rank-nullity bounds above are *loose upper bounds*
that treat each partition's sums as independent information channels. In practice, interlocking partitions create tight
dependencies between sums: a single cell participates in one line from each of the 6 (or 32) partitions, so flipping
that cell perturbs 6 (or 32) sums simultaneously. For a swap pattern to be invisible to the entire partition system, it
must produce zero net change on *every* line it touches. This constraint increases the minimum number of cells involved
in any valid swap, which in turn reduces the number of achievable collisions.

**Minimum swap size with linear partitions.** With only LSM and VSM, the minimal invisible swap is a 4-cell rectangle:
cells at $(r_1, c_1)$, $(r_1, c_2)$, $(r_2, c_1)$, $(r_2, c_2)$ with alternating $+1/-1$ flips. Each row sees one
$+1$ and one $-1$; each column likewise. However, adding DSM and XSM imposes further constraints: the four cells of a
generic rectangle fall on four *distinct* diagonals and four distinct anti-diagonals, each seeing a single unbalanced
$\pm 1$ flip. For the rectangle to also balance DSM, cells must pair on shared diagonals, requiring
$c_1 - r_1 = c_2 - r_2$ and $c_2 - r_1 = c_1 - r_2$, which forces $c_1 = c_2$ --- a degenerate rectangle. The
minimum invisible swap under all four linear partitions is therefore *already larger than 4 cells* for generic
configurations. Balanced swaps require coordinated multi-cell patterns where each of the $4k$ (line, cell) interactions
sums to zero simultaneously.

**Effect of adding PSM and NSM.** Space-filling curve partitions make the balance condition strictly harder. Each of the
$k$ cells in a candidate swap falls on one PSM segment and one NSM segment, in addition to its row, column, diagonal,
and anti-diagonal. For the swap to be invisible to PSM, every PSM segment touching a swap cell must contain an even
number of affected cells with equal $+1/-1$ split. A segment containing a single affected cell detects the swap
immediately. Because Hilbert curve segments are spatially compact and geometrically nonlinear, the probability that $k$
cells pair up within PSM segments *and* within NSM segments *and* balance across all four original families
simultaneously is extremely small.

**Collision probability as a function of minimum swap size.** Let $k_{\min}$ denote the minimum number of cells in an
invisible swap for a 6-partition system. The expected number of collision partners for a uniformly random matrix $M$ is
bounded by:

$$
    E[\text{collisions}] \leq \sum_{k=k_{\min}}^{s^2} \binom{s^2}{k} \cdot 2^{-k} \cdot g_6(k)
$$

where $2^{-k}$ accounts for binary feasibility (each flipped cell must have the correct current value in $M$ to remain
in $\{0,1\}$) and $g_6(k)$ is the probability that a random $k$-cell subset admits a valid balanced swap across all 6
partitions. The factor $g_6(k)$ incorporates two conditions: (a) no line may contain exactly one affected cell (the
"no-singletons" condition), and (b) for each line with $m \geq 2$ affected cells, the $\pm 1$ assignment must sum to
zero.

For condition (a) alone, modeling cell-to-line assignments as Poisson with rate $\lambda = k/s$, the probability that a
single partition has no singleton lines is approximately $\exp(-k \, e^{-k/s})$. For 6 partitions:

$$
    P(\text{no singletons on all 6}) \approx \exp(-6k \, e^{-k/s}).
$$

For condition (b), each line with exactly 2 affected cells must have opposite signs, contributing an additional factor
of approximately $(1/2)$ per such line. The number of 2-cell lines per partition is approximately
$s \cdot \lambda^2 e^{-\lambda}/2 = k^2 / (2s)$ under the Poisson model, giving a per-partition balance factor of
$(1/2)^{k^2/(2s)}$. Across 6 partitions:

$$
    P(\text{pairwise balance}) \approx 2^{-3k^2/s}.
$$

Combining all factors and using $\binom{s^2}{k} \approx (e \, s^2 / k)^k$:

$$
    E[\text{collisions}] \lessapprox \left(\frac{e \, s^2}{2k}\right)^k \cdot \exp(-6k \, e^{-k/s}) \cdot 2^{-3k^2/s}.
$$

The following table evaluates this bound for $s = 511$ (so $s^2 = 261{,}121$) across several values of $k_{\min}$:

| $k_{\min}$ | $\binom{s^2}{k} \cdot 2^{-k}$ | $P(\text{no singletons})$ | $P(\text{balance})$ | $E[\text{collisions}]$ |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 8     | $\approx 10^{38}$  | $\approx 10^{-20}$  | $\approx 10^{-1}$   | $\approx 10^{17}$             |
| 20    | $\approx 10^{79}$  | $\approx 10^{-50}$  | $\approx 10^{-7}$   | $\approx 10^{22}$             |
| 50    | $\approx 10^{168}$ | $\approx 10^{-118}$ | $\approx 10^{-44}$  | $\approx 10^{6}$              |
| 80    | $\approx 10^{247}$ | $\approx 10^{-182}$ | $\approx 10^{-112}$ | $\approx 10^{-47}$            |
| 100   | $\approx 10^{296}$ | $\approx 10^{-222}$ | $\approx 10^{-175}$ | $\approx 10^{-101}$           |
| 150   | $\approx 10^{408}$ | $\approx 10^{-314}$ | $\approx 10^{-395}$ | $\approx 10^{-301}$           |

The critical observation is that for $k_{\min} \gtrsim 80$, the expected number of collision partners drops below 1,
meaning the probability of collision becomes small. At $k_{\min} \geq 100$ the probability is negligible by any
engineering standard, and at $k_{\min} \geq 150$ it approaches the cryptographic regime ($10^{-301}$ is comparable to
$2^{-1{,}000}$).

Whether Hilbert-curve-based PSM/NSM partitions push $k_{\min}$ into this range is an open empirical question. The
nonlinear, spatially compact geometry of Hilbert segments makes it difficult for small cell sets to pair up
simultaneously on all 6 partition families, suggesting $k_{\min}$ may be substantially larger than the linear-only
case. Empirical enumeration at small matrix sizes ($s = 15$ or $s = 31$) would provide direct measurements of
$k_{\min}$ for specific curve geometries, and extrapolation to $s = 511$ would indicate whether sum-only collision
resistance is sufficient in practice or whether LH remains necessary.

**Propagation benefit.** Each additional partition increases the number of constraint lines per cell. With the four
existing families, each cell participates in 4 lines. Adding $k$ partitions raises this to $4 + k$. The propagator's
forcing rules ($\rho = 0$ forces zeros, $\rho = u$ forces ones) trigger independently on each line, so the probability
that a cell remains free after propagation drops from $(1-f)^4$ to $(1-f)^{4+k}$, where $f$ is the per-line forcing
probability. Even $k = 2$ reduces the expected free-cell count by approximately 36\%, which can shrink the DFS
backtracking tree exponentially.

**Proposed geometry: space-filling curve slicing.** A Hilbert curve (or similar space-filling curve) traverses all
$s^2$ cells in a spatially coherent order. Cutting the curve into $s$ consecutive segments of $s$ cells each produces
a partition satisfying all three cross-sum axioms (Section 2.2.1). The orthogonal partner is obtained by applying the
same procedure to a 90°-rotated (transposed) traversal of the matrix. This yields two new cross-sum families:

- **PSM** (P-curve sums): $s = 511$ segments from the Hilbert curve in the natural orientation.
- **NSM** (N-curve sums): $s = 511$ segments from the Hilbert curve over the transposed matrix.

Each segment meanders through a compact spatial region, crossing many rows, columns, diagonals, and anti-diagonals at
non-degenerate angles. Because the Hilbert curve is self-similar and nonlinear, the resulting partitions are
geometrically independent from the four existing linear families, maximizing the incremental constraint information per
added bit.

**Implementation via static lookup tables.** Rather than computing curve coordinates at runtime, the partition
assignments are precomputed at build time by a code-generation script. The script generates two C++ headers, each
containing a `constexpr std::array<uint16_t, 261121>` that maps the flat cell index $(r \times s + c)$ to the
partition line index $k \in \{0, \ldots, 510\}$. At runtime, the constraint store resolves PSM and NSM line membership
via a single array lookup per cell --- identical in cost to the existing row/column index computations and free of
modular arithmetic overhead. The combined table size is approximately 510 KB of static read-only memory, loaded once at
program startup.

**Hilbert curve adaptation for non-power-of-two grids.** The standard Hilbert curve is defined on $2^n \times 2^n$
grids. For $s = 511$, two adaptation strategies exist. First, generate the curve on a $512 \times 512$ grid and
discard the 1,023 cells falling outside the $511 \times 511$ matrix, adjusting the two affected segment lengths
accordingly (these segments would encode their sums using fewer bits, analogous to the variable-length treatment of DSM
and XSM). Second, use a generalized Hilbert curve construction for non-power-of-two dimensions (Hamilton \&
Rau-Chaplin, 2008). The former is simpler to implement; the latter produces a cleaner partition at the cost of a more
complex generator.

**Storage cost and compression ratio impact.** Two additional partitions add $2 \times 4{,}599 = 9{,}198$ bits per
block, increasing the block payload from 156,392 to 165,590 bits. The revised compression ratio becomes:

$$
    C_r = 1 - \frac{165{,}590}{261{,}121} \approx 0.3658
$$

This reduces space savings from 40.1\% to 36.6\% --- a 3.5 percentage-point penalty. Whether this tradeoff is
justified depends on the empirical decompression speedup, which can only be measured once the solver is implemented and
profiled against worst-case inputs (random-looking matrices with sums clustered near $s/2$, where forcing rules trigger
least frequently).

**Open questions.** (a) What is the minimum number of auxiliary partitions needed to bring worst-case decompression
under 1 second on Apple Silicon? (b) Does the Hilbert curve's spatial coherence outperform algebraic constructions
(e.g., toroidal modular-slope lines) in propagation cascade depth, or is crossing density the dominant factor
regardless of geometry? (c) Can auxiliary partitions be combined with the segmented prefix hashes of Section B.1 to
simultaneously accelerate propagation and enable early hash pruning, and if so, what is the optimal allocation of the
LH bit budget between the two mechanisms?

### B.3 Variable-Length Curve Partitions as LH Replacement

Sections B.1 and B.2 explore modifications that *complement* LH. This section considers a more aggressive alternative:
replacing LH entirely with $n$ variable-length partitions structured identically to DSM and XSM --- each consisting of
$2s - 1$ lines with lengths $1, 2, \ldots, s, \ldots, 2, 1$ --- but using space-filling curves rather than straight
lines as the underlying geometry. The motivation is twofold: the short lines at the periphery of each partition provide
deterministic "anchor" cells that seed constraint propagation, and the variable-length structure concentrates collision
resistance where it is strongest (short lines) while providing broad constraint coverage where it is weakest (long
lines).

#### B.3.1 Partition Structure

Each variable-length curve partition $\mathcal{V}$ consists of $2s - 1 = 1{,}021$ lines whose lengths follow the
triangular sequence $\text{len}(k) = \min(k+1,\; s,\; 2s-1-k)$ for $k \in \{0, \ldots, 2s-2\}$. The total cell count
is:

$$
    \sum_{k=0}^{2s-2} \text{len}(k) = 2 \sum_{l=1}^{s-1} l + s = s^2 = 261{,}121
$$

confirming that each partition covers every cell exactly once (Axiom 1, Section 2.2.1). The partition is generated by
traversing a space-filling curve (e.g., Hilbert curve adapted for the $511 \times 511$ grid) and cutting the traversal
into consecutive segments of lengths $1, 2, 3, \ldots, 511, \ldots, 3, 2, 1$. Different partitions use different curve
orientations or distinct space-filling curve families (e.g., Hilbert, Z-order, Peano) to maximize geometric diversity.
As with PSM/NSM (Section B.2), the cell-to-line mapping for each partition is precomputed at build time and stored as a
static lookup table.

#### B.3.2 Anchor Cells and Deterministic Seeding

The distinguishing feature of variable-length partitions is that their shortest lines provide deterministic or
near-deterministic cell values before any branching occurs:

**Length-1 lines (2 per partition).** The sum $\sigma \in \{0, 1\}$ uniquely determines the cell's value. These are
unconditionally solved --- no search, no ambiguity.

**Length-2 lines (2 per partition).** If $\sigma = 0$ or $\sigma = 2$, both cells are determined. If $\sigma = 1$,
$\binom{2}{1} = 2$ configurations remain. Under the uniform random model, $P(\sigma \in \{0, 2\}) = 2/4 = 0.5$, so
each length-2 line solves both cells with probability $1/2$.

**Length-$l$ lines in general.** The number of feasible configurations is $\binom{l}{\sigma}$, which equals 1 when
$\sigma \in \{0, l\}$ and grows toward $\binom{l}{\lfloor l/2 \rfloor}$ as $\sigma$ approaches $l/2$. For a uniformly
random row of length $l$, the expected sum is $l/2$, so the ambiguity per line grows rapidly with length.

With $n$ variable-length partitions, the solver receives $2n$ unconditionally solved cells (from length-1 lines) plus
an expected $\sim n$ additional solved cells from length-2 lines, for a total of approximately $3n$ deterministic seeds
before any branching. Each seed cell participates in $4 + n$ constraint lines (the four original families plus the $n$
new partitions), and each updated line may trigger further forcing via the propagator's $\rho = 0$ and $\rho = u$
rules. The resulting cascade can solve substantially more than $3n$ cells before the first branch point.

For small line lengths $l$, the probability that the line is fully determined (i.e., $\sigma \in \{0, l\}$) under the
uniform random model is $2/2^l$, and the probability that at most 2 configurations remain (i.e.,
$\sigma \in \{0, 1, l-1, l\}$) is $2(l+1)/2^l$. The following table summarizes the deterministic yield for the
shortest lines of each partition:

| Length $l$ | Lines per partition | $P(\text{fully determined})$ | $P(\leq 2 \text{ configs})$ | Ambiguity at $\sigma = \lfloor l/2 \rfloor$ |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1  | 2 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 1 |
| 2  | 2 | 0.500 | 1.000 | 2 |
| 3  | 2 | 0.250 | 0.750 | 3 |
| 4  | 2 | 0.125 | 0.625 | 6 |
| 5  | 2 | 0.063 | 0.375 | 10 |
| 10 | 2 | 0.002 | 0.022 | 252 |
| 50 | 2 | $\approx 10^{-15}$ | $\approx 10^{-13}$ | $\approx 10^{14}$ |

Beyond approximately $l = 10$, the lines behave similarly to the uniform-length lines of Section B.2 --- they provide
constraint information but little deterministic solving power. The value of the variable-length structure is
concentrated in the first $\sim 10$ line-length tiers (20 lines per partition), which together cover
$2(1 + 2 + \cdots + 10) = 110$ cells per partition.

#### B.3.3 Collision Risk Reduction

The anchor cells from length-1 lines cannot participate in any swap: their values are unconditionally determined by a
single sum constraint. This removes $2n$ cells from the swappable pool entirely. More significantly, anchor cells that
propagate through other partitions fix additional cells, creating a cascade of determined values that further constrains
the space of valid swap patterns.

The collision resistance of a variable-length partition can be decomposed by line length. For a single partition, the
total number of configurations consistent with a given set of sums is:

$$
    N_{\mathcal{V}} = \prod_{k=0}^{2s-2} \binom{\text{len}(k)}{\sigma(k)}.
$$

Under the uniform random model ($\sigma(k) \approx \text{len}(k)/2$), the dominant contributions come from the longest
lines. The short lines ($l \leq 10$) contribute a factor of at most $\prod_{l=1}^{10} (\binom{l}{\lfloor l/2
\rfloor})^2 = (1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 6 \cdot 10 \cdot 20 \cdot 35 \cdot 70 \cdot 126 \cdot 252)^2 \approx
1.3 \times 10^{21}$, while the center line ($l = 511$) alone contributes $\binom{511}{255} \approx 10^{153}$. The
collision resistance is therefore dominated by the long lines, and the short lines' contribution is to provide
*deterministic anchors* rather than probabilistic collision barriers.

However, the anchors interact with other partitions through the interlocking structure. A cell solved by a length-1
line in partition $\mathcal{V}_1$ constrains lines in all other partitions passing through that cell. If partition
$\mathcal{V}_2$ has a length-3 line containing an anchored cell, the effective ambiguity of that length-3 line drops
from $\binom{3}{\sigma}$ to $\binom{2}{\sigma - v}$ where $v$ is the anchor's value --- a reduction by factor
$\sim 3/2$. With $n$ partitions providing $2n$ anchors scattered across the matrix, the cross-partition reduction
compounds multiplicatively.

The net effect on collision probability depends on the spatial distribution of anchor cells relative to the short lines
of other partitions. If partition geometries are chosen so that each partition's anchor cells fall on short lines of
other partitions (maximizing cross-partition constraint tightening), the compounding effect is strongest. This is a
design criterion for the space-filling curve selection: curves should be oriented so that their length-1 endpoints are
spatially dispersed across regions covered by other curves' short segments.

#### B.3.4 Decompression Performance

The variable-length structure provides a qualitatively different propagation dynamic compared to uniform-length
partitions. With uniform partitions (Section B.2), all lines have length $s = 511$, and forcing rules trigger only
when a line's residual reaches 0 or equals its unknown count --- unlikely for a fresh line with 511 unknowns. With
variable-length partitions, the short lines begin with small unknown counts and are far more likely to trigger forcing
immediately.

Consider the propagation sequence on initial state. The $2n$ length-1 lines solve their cells unconditionally. Each
solved cell updates its row, column, diagonal, anti-diagonal, and the lines it belongs to in all $n$ new partitions.
These updates decrease $u(L)$ on each affected line by 1 and (if the solved value is 1) increase $a(L)$ and decrease
$\rho(L)$ by 1. For a length-2 line that already had $\sigma \in \{0, 2\}$, the single update is sufficient to force
the remaining cell. For a length-3 line, the update may push it into a forcing state. The cascade propagates inward
from the short lines toward the long lines, with each wave of solved cells enabling the next tier.

This "warm start" effect is unique to variable-length partitions. Uniform-length partitions offer no free solutions at
initialization --- the solver must wait for branching and propagation to create forcing conditions. Variable-length
partitions front-load the easy constraints, reducing the effective matrix size before the first branch point. If the
cascade solves a sufficient fraction of cells (even 5--10\% of the matrix), the remaining search tree is dramatically
smaller.

#### B.3.5 Storage Budget and Partition Count

Each variable-length partition requires $B_d(s) = 8{,}185$ bits (identical to DSM and XSM), compared to $4{,}599$ bits
for a uniform-length partition. Because the existing partitions are organized as orthogonal pairs (LSM--VSM,
DSM--XSM), any new partitions must likewise come in pairs to maintain the interlocking pair structure. This gives
$n = 16$ partitions (8 orthogonal pairs), costing $16 \times 8{,}185 = 130{,}960$ bits --- exceeding the LH budget of
$130{,}816$ bits by only 144 bits (0.11\%), a negligible overrun that can be absorbed by a trivial format adjustment.

These 16 partitions provide 32 unconditional anchor cells (from length-1 lines), approximately 16 additional anchor
cells from length-2 lines (in expectation), and 110 cells per partition in the "high-information" short-line tiers
($l \leq 10$), totaling $16 \times 110 = 1{,}760$ cells with strong deterministic or near-deterministic constraints.
The revised block payload is:

$$
    B_{\text{block}} = \underbrace{9{,}198}_{\text{LSM+VSM}} + \underbrace{16{,}370}_{\text{DSM+XSM}}
    + \underbrace{8}_{\text{DI}} + \underbrace{16 \times 8{,}185}_{\text{16 partitions}} = 156{,}536 \text{ bits}.
$$

$$
    C_r = 1 - \frac{156{,}536}{261{,}121} \approx 0.4005
$$

At 40.1\% space savings, the 16-partition design is compression-neutral relative to the current LH design while
providing 32 anchor cells, 1,760 high-information cells, and 16 additional constraint lines per cell for propagation
acceleration.

#### B.3.6 Comparison of Approaches

| Property | LH (current) | B.2: 2 uniform curves | B.3: 16 var-length (8 pairs) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Storage (bits) | 130,816 | 9,198 (+ LH) | 130,960 |
| Space savings | 40.1% | 36.6% (with LH) | 40.1% |
| Anchor cells | 0 | 0 | 32 + ~16 probable |
| Collision resistance | Cryptographic ($2^{-256}$/row) | Linear only | Anchor + interlocking |
| Propagation seeds | 0 (hash is post-hoc) | 0 | 32+ free cells |
| Lines per cell | 4 + 0 | 4 + 2 | 4 + 16 |
| Solver warm start | No | No | Yes |

#### B.3.7 Existence and Selection of Eight Orthogonal Curve Pairs

The B.3 proposal requires 16 variable-length partitions organized as 8 orthogonal pairs. This subsection examines
whether 8 such pairs can be constructed from space-filling curves and, if so, what construction strategies are
available. The analysis draws on the combinatorial theory of space-filling curves, the classical theory of mutually
orthogonal Latin squares (MOLS), and the computational geometry of locality-preserving mappings.

**Defining orthogonality for curve-based partitions.** For linear partitions, orthogonality has a precise algebraic
definition: two families of parallel lines with slopes $m$ and $-1/m$ satisfy the *maximum crossing property* --- every
line from one family intersects every line from the other in exactly one cell (Colbourn & Dinitz, 2007). For
curve-based partitions, lines are not straight, so the algebraic definition does not apply directly. The appropriate
generalization is *dense distributed crossing*: partitions $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ form an orthogonal pair if
(a) every line in $\mathcal{P}$ of length $l_p$ intersects every line in $\mathcal{Q}$ of length $l_q$ in at most
$\lceil l_p l_q / s^2 \rceil + O(1)$ cells, and (b) the intersection pattern exhibits no systematic alignment that
would permit small balanced swap patterns to remain invisible to both partitions simultaneously. Property (a) ensures
that constraint information propagates uniformly between the two partitions; property (b) ensures that the interlocking
effect discussed in Section B.2 is maximized. For linear partitions, both properties follow from the slope
relationship. For curve partitions, both must be verified empirically or established through the structural properties
of the curve family.

**Natural pairing via transposition.** The simplest orthogonal pairing mirrors the LSM--VSM relationship: given a
space-filling curve $C$ that traverses the $s \times s$ matrix, define $C^T$ as the curve obtained by transposing the
matrix (swapping row and column indices). If $C$ visits cell $(r, c)$ at step $t$, then $C^T$ visits $(c, r)$ at step
$t$. Partitions derived from $C$ and $C^T$ using the same segment schedule are geometrically perpendicular in the
following sense: where $C$ traverses a region predominantly horizontally, $C^T$ traverses the transposed region
predominantly vertically. Sagan (1994) established that the Hilbert curve and its variants exhibit strong directional
coherence within each recursive quadrant, so transposition produces traversals with complementary directional
structure. This gives one orthogonal pair per base curve.

**Counting distinct space-filling curves.** To obtain 8 orthogonal pairs, 8 geometrically distinct base curves are
needed. The space of Hilbert-class curves is far richer than the single canonical Hilbert curve suggests. Haverkort
(2017) enumerated the structurally distinct face-continuous space-filling curves based on Hilbert-type recursion in two
dimensions and found 1,536 distinct curve variants (up to symmetry) for the standard $2^n \times 2^n$ grid. Each
variant differs in the orientation and reflection of recursive sub-quadrants at each level of the recursion. For the
$512 \times 512$ grid (9 levels of recursion), the combinatorial freedom at each level produces a vast family of
traversals that all visit every cell exactly once but in different orders.

Beyond Hilbert-type curves, other space-filling curve families offer structurally independent traversals. The Z-order
(Morton) curve follows a bit-interleaving pattern that produces a fundamentally different spatial clustering than the
Hilbert curve's recursive U-shaped traversal (Mokbel & Aref, 2001). The Peano curve uses a $3 \times 3$ recursive
subdivision rather than $2 \times 2$, producing a traversal with different locality properties (Sagan, 1994). Selecting
base curves from different families maximizes the geometric diversity between partitions, which in turn maximizes the
crossing density between orthogonal pairs.

**A concrete construction for 8 base curves.** The following strategy produces 8 geometrically distinct base curves for
the $511 \times 511$ matrix (adapted from $512 \times 512$ by discarding out-of-bounds cells per Section B.2):

(1--2) The canonical Hilbert curve and a Hilbert variant with reversed sub-quadrant orientations at the first recursion
level. These differ in which quadrant is visited first and the direction of traversal between quadrants, producing
traversals with complementary spatial coherence at the coarsest scale.

(3--4) The Z-order (Morton) curve and a reflected Z-order curve (horizontal reflection of the bit-interleaving
pattern). Z-order curves have weaker locality than Hilbert curves --- Niedermeier et al. (2002) showed that the Hilbert
curve is optimal among all $2 \times 2$ recursion-based curves for locality, while the Z-order curve trades locality
for computational simplicity --- which means Z-order partitions cross Hilbert partitions at different spatial scales,
providing complementary constraint structure.

(5--6) Two Hilbert curve variants with distinct recursion patterns at the second level of subdivision. At each level,
the Hilbert curve recursion offers four orientation choices per sub-quadrant; varying these at level 2 (the $128
\times 128$ sub-grid scale) produces traversals that agree at the coarsest level but diverge within each quadrant.

(7--8) A Peano-type curve adapted to $512 \times 512$ (via nested $3 \times 3$ subdivisions with padding) and a
rotated variant. The $3 \times 3$ recursion base produces a traversal structure incommensurable with the $2 \times 2$
Hilbert and Z-order families, maximizing geometric independence (Bader, 2013).

Each base curve $C_i$ paired with its transpose $C_i^T$ yields one orthogonal pair, giving 8 pairs and 16 partitions
total. The variable-length segment schedule ($1, 2, \ldots, s, \ldots, 2, 1$) is applied identically to each curve.

**Axiom verification.** Axiom 1 (Conservation) holds by construction: each curve visits all $s^2$ cells, and the
segment schedule sums to $s^2$. Axiom 3 (Non-repetition) holds because each curve is a Hamiltonian path, so no cell is
visited twice. Axiom 2 (Uniqueness) requires that no two lines across any pair of the 20 total partitions (4 original

- 16 new) cover the identical set of cells. For lines derived from geometrically distinct curves, cell-set identity
would require two different traversals to visit exactly the same cells in the same contiguous block of the segment
schedule --- a combinatorial coincidence with probability vanishing in $s$. A build-time verification step (the code
generator checks all $\binom{20 \times 1021}{2}$ pairs of lines for set equality) provides a hard guarantee at zero
runtime cost. Hamilton and Rau-Chaplin (2008) demonstrated that compact Hilbert index computations for non-square
grids are efficient and deterministic, confirming that the adaptation from $512 \times 512$ to $511 \times 511$ is
computationally tractable for the code generator.

**Limitations of the curve-based orthogonality guarantee.** Unlike linear partitions, where the maximum crossing
property is a mathematical theorem, the dense distributed crossing property for curve-based partitions is a structural
expectation rather than a proof. The recursive self-similarity of Hilbert-type curves provides strong heuristic grounds
--- Bader (2013) showed that Hilbert curves achieve near-optimal locality in the sense that spatially nearby cells
are visited close together in the traversal, which implies that segments cover compact regions and cross other
partitions' segments broadly --- but a formal proof that all 8 pairs satisfy property (b) for all possible matrices
does not yet exist. The build-time verification described above addresses property (a) computationally; property (b)
can be assessed empirically by computing the intersection matrices for the chosen curves and checking for degenerate
alignment patterns.

**Connection to Latin square theory.** For uniform-length partitions ($s$ groups of $s$ cells), the existence of
mutually orthogonal families is governed by the theory of MOLS. Colbourn and Dinitz (2007) established that for any
prime power $q$, exactly $q - 1$ MOLS of order $q$ exist, and for composite orders, lower bounds on the number of MOLS
are given by the MacNeish--Mann theorem: $N(n) \geq \min(q_i - 1)$ where $n = \prod q_i^{a_i}$. For $s = 511 = 7
\times 73$, this gives $N(511) \geq 6$, guaranteeing at least 6 mutually orthogonal uniform partitions --- more than
enough for 8 pairs if uniform partitions were used. However, the variable-length structure required by B.3 does not
correspond to a Latin square, so the MOLS bound does not directly apply. The MOLS result does confirm that the
underlying combinatorial space of the $511 \times 511$ grid is rich enough to support many mutually orthogonal
decompositions, lending plausibility to the curve-based construction even absent a formal equivalence theorem.

#### B.3.8 Open Questions

(a) What is the empirically measured $k_{\min}$ (minimum invisible swap size) for a 6-partition system comprising LSM,
VSM, DSM, XSM, and two variable-length curve partitions at small matrix sizes ($s = 15$, $s = 31$)? How does
$k_{\min}$ scale as $n$ increases from 2 to 16?

(b) For 16 variable-length curve partitions (8 orthogonal pairs) with well-chosen geometries, does the
cascade from anchor cells and short lines solve a sufficient fraction of the matrix that the remaining search tree fits
within a 1-second wall-clock budget on Apple Silicon?

(c) Is the collision resistance from interlocking variable-length partitions sufficient to eliminate LH entirely, or
should a hybrid approach retain a reduced LH (e.g., truncated 32-bit hashes, costing $32 \times 511 = 16{,}352$ bits)
alongside a smaller number of auxiliary partitions?

(d) What is the optimal space-filling curve family and orientation strategy for maximizing cross-partition anchor
dispersion --- i.e., ensuring that each partition's length-1 endpoints fall on short lines of other partitions?

(e) Can the variable-length segment schedule be optimized beyond the triangular sequence $1, 2, \ldots, s, \ldots, 2,
1$? For example, a schedule with more short segments (e.g., repeating the $1, 2, 3$ prefix) would provide more anchors
at the cost of fewer long segments, changing the collision/propagation tradeoff.

(f) Can the dense distributed crossing property (Section B.3.7) be formally proved for any specific family of 8 curve
pairs, or must it remain an empirically verified property? Is there a combinatorial framework analogous to MOLS theory
that governs the existence of mutually orthogonal variable-length partitions on finite grids?

### B.4 Diagonal-Primary Corner-Inward Solver Reorientation

The current solver (Section 5) assigns cells in row-major order, treating LSM and VSM as the primary constraint axes
and DSM and XSM as secondary propagation aids. This section proposes inverting the priority: treat the diagonal (DSM)
and anti-diagonal (XSM) families as the primary axes and reorder cell assignment to follow the natural constraint
gradient from corners inward. This reorientation requires no changes to the compressed file format, no additional
storage, and no new partitions --- it is purely an algorithmic change that exploits structure already present in every
CRSCE block.

#### B.4.1 The Rotated Coordinate System

Define diagonal coordinate $d = c - r + (s - 1)$ and anti-diagonal coordinate $x = r + c$, consistent with the
indexing in Section 2.2. In this rotated frame, DSM and XSM become the "row sums" and "column sums" of a
diamond-shaped grid, while LSM and VSM become "diagonal sums" of the rotated system. The critical asymmetry between
the two coordinate systems is that DSM and XSM lines have variable lengths ranging from 1 to $s$, while LSM and VSM
lines are uniformly length $s = 511$. This variable-length structure creates a constraint gradient that the row-major
solver does not exploit: cells near the matrix corners sit on the shortest DSM/XSM lines and are the most tightly
constrained, while cells near the center sit on the longest lines and are the least constrained.

#### B.4.2 Corner-Inward Traversal Order

Define the *ring index* of cell $(r, c)$ as the Chebyshev distance from the nearest corner:

$$
    \text{ring}(r, c) = \min(r,\; c,\; s{-}1{-}r,\; s{-}1{-}c).
$$

The corner-inward traversal assigns cells in order of increasing ring index, with ties broken by a deterministic
rule (e.g., clockwise traversal within each ring starting from the top-left corner). This processes the matrix in
concentric rectangular rings:

Ring 0 (perimeter): $4(s - 1) = 2{,}040$ cells. Contains all 4 cells on length-1 DSM lines and all 4 cells on
length-1 XSM lines (these overlap at the 4 matrix corners, yielding 4 unconditionally determined cells). The remaining
perimeter cells sit on DSM/XSM lines of lengths 2 through $\lceil s/2 \rceil$.

Ring 1: $4(s - 3) = 2{,}032$ cells. DSM/XSM line lengths are at least 2 greater than Ring 0's equivalents.

Ring $\lfloor (s-1)/2 \rfloor = 255$ (center): 1 cell at $(255, 255)$, on the longest diagonal and anti-diagonal (both
length $s = 511$). The least constrained cell in the matrix.

The total ring count is $\lceil s/2 \rceil = 256$, and the constraint tightness decreases monotonically from Ring 0 to
Ring 255.

#### B.4.3 Precomputed Address Lookup Tables

The coordinate conversions $d = c - r + (s-1)$ and $x = r + c$ are each a single addition and subtraction, but in
the inner loop of the constraint propagator these operations execute billions of times per block. Two precomputed
static lookup tables eliminate this arithmetic entirely:

**Diagonal index table:** A `constexpr std::array<uint16_t, 261121>` mapping the flat cell index
$(r \times s + c)$ to the DSM line index $d$. At build time, the generator computes $d = c - r + (s-1)$ for each
$(r, c)$ pair. At runtime, the constraint store resolves any cell's diagonal membership via a single array lookup.

**Anti-diagonal index table:** An identical `constexpr std::array<uint16_t, 261121>` mapping the flat cell index to
the XSM line index $x = r + c$.

Each table occupies $261{,}121 \times 2 = 522{,}242$ bytes ($\approx 510$ KB), for a combined footprint of
$\approx 1$ MB of static read-only memory. The tables are generated once at build time, loaded at program startup,
and shared across all block operations. The per-lookup cost is a single indexed memory access --- typically a
cache-line hit after the first few accesses warm the L1/L2 cache --- replacing two integer arithmetic operations per
cell per propagation step.

For the corner-inward traversal itself, a third table maps traversal step index to flat cell index:

**Traversal order table:** A `constexpr std::array<uint32_t, 261121>` containing the flat cell indices in
corner-inward ring order. The solver iterates through this table sequentially, selecting the next unassigned cell by
advancing the traversal pointer rather than scanning for the first unassigned cell in row-major order. This reduces
next-cell selection from $O(s^2)$ scan (in the worst case) to $O(1)$ indexed lookup.

The combined memory cost of all three tables is approximately 1.5 MB --- negligible relative to the L2 cache budget
on Apple Silicon (M-series chips provide 16--48 MB of shared L2 cache per performance cluster) and small relative to
the constraint store itself (which maintains per-line statistics for $3{,}064$ lines).

#### B.4.4 Constraint Cascade from Corners

The 4 matrix corners are each determined unconditionally by length-1 DSM and XSM lines before any search begins. Each
solved corner cell updates its row (LSM), column (VSM), and one additional line each in DSM and XSM (the
length-1 lines are already consumed). The row and column updates reduce the unknown count $u$ and adjust the
residual $\rho$ on those lines, potentially triggering forcing on other cells within those rows or columns.

The cells adjacent to corners sit on length-2 DSM and XSM lines. A length-2 line with sum $\sigma \in \{0, 2\}$
determines both cells immediately; with $\sigma = 1$, only 2 configurations remain, and the LSM/VSM/opposite-family
constraint through each cell may resolve the ambiguity. Under the uniform random model, $P(\sigma \in \{0, 2\}) = 0.5$,
so approximately half of the length-2 lines solve both cells outright. Each newly solved cell cascades further through
all 4 partition families.

The cascade propagates inward ring by ring. At each ring, the newly determined cells from the previous ring's
propagation have updated the row, column, diagonal, and anti-diagonal statistics for the current ring's cells. The
cumulative effect is that the solver encounters progressively more constrained cells as it moves inward, because:

(a) Each cell's row and column have fewer unknowns remaining (prior rings have assigned cells at the row/column
endpoints).

(b) Each cell's diagonal and anti-diagonal are longer than the previous ring's (more unknowns), but the row/column
forcing from (a) may have already determined some cells on these longer diagonals.

(c) The propagator's forcing rules ($\rho = 0$ forces zeros, $\rho = u$ forces ones) trigger more readily as $u$
decreases on any of the 4 lines through each cell.

#### B.4.5 Interaction with LH

The lateral hash check (Section 5.2) requires $u(\text{row}) = 0$ to fire. With corner-inward traversal, rows are
not completed sequentially --- cells from both ends of each row are assigned in early rings, with center cells
assigned in later rings. This delays hash verification compared to row-major order, where each row completes after
exactly $s$ assignments.

However, the delay may be shorter than expected. As corner cells propagate through column constraints, interior cells
on the same columns may be forced by column residuals reaching 0 or $u$, completing rows from the middle outward.
The rows nearest the top and bottom edges (rows 0, 1, $s{-}2$, $s{-}1$) have the most cells on short diagonals and
are likely to complete first. The center row (row 255) is completed last, as its cells sit on the longest diagonals.

The hash check remains fully effective once a row completes: a mismatch triggers immediate backtracking regardless of
the order in which the row's cells were assigned. The practical question is whether the reduced branching factor from
the corner-inward cascade compensates for the delayed hash pruning.

A hybrid strategy mitigates this tension: the solver primarily follows the corner-inward ring order but
*opportunistically* assigns remaining cells in a nearly-complete row (e.g., $u(\text{row}) \leq 3$) to trigger the
hash check early, then resumes the ring traversal. This requires maintaining a priority queue of rows sorted by
unknown count, checked periodically during propagation. The overhead is minimal --- a scan of $s = 511$ row
statistics --- and the payoff is earlier hash-based pruning.

#### B.4.6 DI Semantics Under Corner-Inward Order

The canonical ordering (Section 4.1) must be redefined from row-major lexicographic to corner-inward ring-major
lexicographic. The solution $S_0$ is the lex-first feasible matrix under the corner-inward cell ordering (with 0
before 1 at each branch point). The compressor discovers DI by running the decompressor with the same corner-inward
enumeration, so the DI mechanism is preserved identically.

The only format-level implication is that the specification must document the traversal order unambiguously. The
precomputed traversal order table (Section B.4.3) serves as the definitive reference: both compressor and decompressor
use the identical table, guaranteeing identical enumeration order and deterministic DI semantics.

#### B.4.7 Computational Complexity Comparison

The per-node cost is identical to the current solver --- each assignment updates 4 lines, and propagation processes the
same forcing rules. The lookup tables replace two arithmetic operations per cell with one memory access per cell,
yielding a small constant-factor speedup in the propagator's inner loop. The dominant complexity difference is in the
search tree size:

**Row-major (current):** The solver encounters cells in an order uncorrelated with constraint tightness. Short-diagonal
cells (corners) and long-diagonal cells (center) are interleaved within each row. The effective branching factor is
uniform across the traversal --- the solver has no opportunity to concentrate its effort where constraints are tightest.
The search tree depth is the total number of cells not forced by propagation, and the branching factor reflects the
average per-cell ambiguity across all diagonal lengths.

**Corner-inward:** The solver encounters cells in order of decreasing constraint tightness. Early rings have low
branching factors (many cells forced by short diagonals), and the cumulative propagation from solved outer cells
reduces the branching factor for inner rings. The search tree is *front-loaded* with easy decisions and
*back-loaded* with hard ones --- but the hard ones are maximally constrained by the time they are reached.

The net effect is a reduction in the effective tree size without any increase in per-node cost. The reduction is
difficult to quantify analytically because it depends on the cascade dynamics between the four partition families, but
the qualitative argument is unambiguous: presenting the most constrained cells first to a backtracking solver with
propagation is a well-established heuristic in constraint satisfaction (known as the *fail-first* or *most
constrained variable* principle) and is empirically superior to arbitrary variable ordering in virtually all studied
CSP domains (Haralick & Elliott, 1980; Bessière, 2006).

#### B.4.8 Diagonal-First Pruning versus Row-First Hash Verification

The corner-inward traversal creates a fundamental tension between two competing objectives: evaluating DSM/XSM
constraints early to disqualify infeasible subtrees quickly, and completing rows early to trigger LH verification.
Row-major order resolves this tension trivially in favor of rows --- each row completes after exactly $s$ assignments,
enabling an LH check every 511 cells --- but at the cost of underexploiting DSM/XSM's variable-length constraint
gradient until late in the search. Corner-inward order inverts the tradeoff: short diagonals and anti-diagonals
complete in the first few rings, delivering aggressive early pruning, but rows complete unpredictably as cells arrive
from both ends.

Neither extreme is optimal. A *diagonal-biased row-aware* traversal strategy can reconcile the two objectives. The
branching controller maintains both the ring-order traversal pointer and a row-completion watchlist tracking
$u(\text{row})$ for all 511 rows. At each branching decision, the controller selects whichever unassigned cell
offers the highest expected pruning value according to two competing signals: (a) cells on short or nearly-complete
diagonal/anti-diagonal lines, which are likely to trigger propagation cascades or infeasibility detection, and
(b) cells on nearly-complete rows (e.g., $u(\text{row}) \leq t$ for a tunable threshold $t$), which are close to
enabling an LH verification that can prune entire subtrees with cryptographic certainty.

The threshold $t$ governs the balance. At $t = 0$, the solver never interrupts the ring traversal for hash
verification --- equivalent to pure corner-inward order with opportunistic LH checks only when rows happen to
complete. At $t = s$, the solver always prioritizes rows --- equivalent to row-major order. Intermediate values
(empirically, $t \in [3, 8]$ is a plausible starting range) allow the solver to "finish off" rows that are within
a few cells of completion without abandoning the diagonal-first traversal for rows that are far from done.

This hybrid strategy can be implemented without modifying the propagation engine. The branching controller's cell
selection logic changes from a single traversal pointer to a priority function over unassigned cells, but the
precomputed lookup tables (Section B.4.3) provide the necessary information: each cell's ring index, diagonal
lengths, and row membership are all available in $O(1)$. The row-completion watchlist is maintained incrementally
--- each assignment decrements $u(\text{row})$ for the affected row, and rows crossing the threshold $t$ are added
to the watchlist. The per-decision overhead is bounded by the watchlist size, which is at most $s = 511$ entries.

The net effect is a solver that exploits DSM/XSM's constraint gradient for the majority of the search (where
diagonal pruning has the highest leverage) while opportunistically completing rows for LH verification whenever
doing so is cheap (a few remaining cells) and high-value (cryptographic pruning of an entire subtree).

#### B.4.9 Open Questions

(a) What is the empirical speedup of corner-inward traversal over row-major traversal for the existing 4-partition +
LH design, measured on random, all-zeros, all-ones, and adversarial inputs at $s = 511$?

(b) Does the hybrid diagonal-biased row-aware strategy (Section B.4.8) recover the hash pruning efficiency lost by
non-sequential row completion, and if so, what is the optimal threshold $t$ for $u(\text{row})$ at which to interrupt
the ring traversal for hash verification?

(c) Is the Chebyshev ring order optimal, or does the anti-diagonal wavefront order ($x = r + c$, processing cells in
order of increasing $x$) provide better cascade dynamics by completing entire anti-diagonals sequentially and enabling
XSM-based verification at anti-diagonal boundaries?

(d) For the diagonal-biased row-aware strategy, is a static threshold $t$ sufficient, or should $t$ adapt dynamically
based on search depth, propagation success rate, or the number of backtracks observed so far?
