## Appendix A. Command-Line Usage

The CRSCE project produces two primary binaries, `compress` and `decompress`, which share a common argument parser and
follow identical conventions for flags, validation, and exit codes.

### A.1 Compress

```text
usage: compress -in <file> -out <file>
```

The `compress` binary reads an uncompressed input file, partitions it into $511 \times 511$-bit blocks, compresses each
block independently per the format defined in Section 12, and writes the compressed output. If any block exceeds
`max_compression_time`, the entire operation fails and no output is produced.

**Flags:**

- `-in <path>` — Path to the input file (required). The file must exist.
- `-out <path>` — Path to the output file (required). The file must not already exist.
- `-h` or `--help` — Display usage information and exit.

### A.2 Decompress

```text
usage: decompress -in <file> -out <file>
```

The `decompress` binary reads a CRSCE-compressed file, reconstructs each block by solving the constraint system to
$S_{\text{DI}}$ (Section 5.5), and writes the recovered bitstream. Decompression is deterministic and unbounded in time;
it either succeeds or reports a malformed payload.

**Flags:**

- `-in <path>` — Path to the compressed input file (required). The file must exist.
- `-out <path>` — Path to the output file (required). The file must not already exist.
- `-h` or `--help` — Display usage information and exit.

### A.3 Exit Codes

Both binaries use the same exit code conventions.

| Code | Meaning                                                               |
|----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|0     |Success, or help displayed, or no arguments provided                   |
|2     |Parse error (unknown flag or missing value for -in/-out)               |
|3     |Filesystem validation error (input file missing or output file exists) |

When no arguments are provided, `compress` prints `"crsce-compress: ready"` to standard output and exits with code 0.
When `-h` or `--help` is present, both binaries print the usage string to standard output and exit with code 0. Parse
errors and filesystem validation errors are printed to standard error.

### A.4 Environment Variables

Both binaries recognize the following environment variables.

```text
Variable                      Default                      Description
----------------------------  ---------------------------  ----------------------------------
MAX_COMPRESSION_TIME          1800                         Max compression time per block (s)
OBSERVABILITY_LOG_FILE        ./log/<program_name>.log     Path to the append-only JSON-L log
OBSERVABILITY_FLUSH_INTERVAL  1000                         Periodic flush interval (ms)
```

The `MAX_COMPRESSION_TIME` variable specifies the wall-clock time limit, in seconds, for compressing a single block
including DI discovery (Section 4.4). If the variable is not set, the default is 1,800 seconds (30 minutes). If the
compressor exceeds this limit on any block, the entire operation fails and no output is produced. This variable is
recognized only by the `compress` binary; the `decompress` binary ignores it, as decompression is unbounded in time by
design (Section 10.1).

The `OBSERVABILITY_LOG_FILE` variable specifies the file to which the O11y background thread (Section 10.5) writes event
and counter records. If the variable is not set, the default path is `./log/compress.log` or `./log/decompress.log` as
appropriate. The log directory is created if it does not exist. The file is opened in append-only mode, ensuring that
records from prior runs are never overwritten.

The `OBSERVABILITY_FLUSH_INTERVAL` variable specifies the period, in milliseconds, at which the O11y background thread
flushes buffered events and counter snapshots to disk. If the variable is not set, the default interval is 1,000 ms.
Setting a shorter interval improves observability latency at the cost of more frequent I/O; setting a longer interval
reduces I/O overhead during high-throughput solver phases.
