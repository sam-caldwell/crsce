### B.4 Dynamic Row-Completion Priority in Cell Selection (Implemented; Subsumed by B.10)

*The row-completion priority queue described in this appendix has been implemented. B.10 generalizes this design into
a multi-line tightness-driven ordering; B.4's implementation is the first stage of the B.10 strategy, corresponding
to the degenerate case where only row weights are non-zero.*

The `RowDecomposedController` (Section 10.4) computes a global cell ordering via
`ProbabilityEstimator::computeGlobalCellScores()` once before the DFS begins, then walks that static ordering for the
entire solve. The ordering reflects constraint tightness at the moment of computation but becomes increasingly stale
as the DFS progresses: propagation forces cells across many rows, dynamically changing per-row unknown counts
$u(\text{row})$, yet the cell ordering never updates to reflect these changes. This appendix proposes replacing the
static ordering with a *dynamic row-completion priority queue* that reacts to $u(\text{row})$ changes during the
solve, steering the solver toward earlier SHA-1 lateral-hash (LH) verification without sacrificing DI determinism.

#### B.4.1 Motivation

The LH check (Section 5.2) fires when $u(\text{row}_r) = 0$&mdash;when every cell in row $r$ has been assigned. A SHA-1
mismatch prunes the entire subtree rooted at the most recent branching decision, providing cryptographic-strength
pruning that is far more powerful than cardinality-based propagation alone. Current performance data shows approximately
200,000 hash mismatches per second at the depth plateau (~87K cells, row ~170), confirming that LH verification is the
dominant pruning mechanism in the mid-solve.

The current `ProbabilityEstimator` does not account for this, and more critically, the cell ordering is computed once
and never revisited. During the DFS, propagation cascades routinely force cells across multiple rows. A row that began
the solve with $u = 511$ may reach $u = 3$ due to column, diagonal, or slope forcing&mdash;but its remaining cells sit
at their original positions deep in the static ordering, unreachable for potentially thousands of iterations. The
solver continues branching on cells selected by stale confidence scores while a nearly-complete row waits, its LH
check tantalizingly close but inaccessible.

The waste is quantifiable. Each iteration that could have completed a row but instead branches elsewhere is an
iteration whose subtree cannot benefit from LH pruning. If the solver is running at 510K iter/sec and a row with
$u = 2$ must wait 1,000 iterations to be reached in the static ordering, those 1,000 iterations (~2 ms) explore
subtrees that a single LH check might have pruned entirely.

#### B.4.2 The Static Ordering Problem

The current implementation in `RowDecomposedController::enumerateSolutionsLex()` calls
`computeGlobalCellScores()` once after initial propagation (line 165). The returned vector is sorted by confidence
descending and stored as `cellOrder`. The DFS stack stores indices into this vector (`orderIdx`), and cell selection
advances sequentially through the array, skipping cells that propagation has already assigned.

This design has three consequences:

(a) *No reaction to $u(\text{row})$ changes.* When propagation drives a row to near-completion, the solver cannot
reprioritize that row's remaining cells. They will be reached only when the sequential scan arrives at their position.

(b) *Stale confidence scores.* The 7-line residual products that determine confidence change with every assignment and
propagation cascade. A cell that was weakly constrained at the start of the solve may become highly constrained after
50,000 assignments&mdash;but its confidence score still reflects the initial state.

(c) *No cost to fix.* The DFS stack's `orderIdx` values are the sole obstacle to dynamic reordering. Replacing the
static array walk with a priority-queue lookup preserves all other DFS mechanics (undo stack, hash verification,
probe integration) unchanged.

#### B.4.3 Proposed Design: Row-Completion Priority Queue

The proposal adds a lightweight priority queue alongside the existing static ordering. The static ordering remains the
default cell source; the priority queue overrides it only when a row crosses a completion threshold.

**Data structure.** A min-heap keyed on $u(\text{row})$, containing entries of the form $(\text{row},\; u)$ for each
row with $0 < u(\text{row}) \leq \tau$, where $\tau$ is a tunable threshold. The heap occupies at most $s = 511$
entries and supports $O(\log s)$ insert and extract-min.

**Threshold crossing.** After each propagation wave (both the direct assignment and all forced cells), the solver
checks $u(\text{row})$ for every row affected by the wave. If a row's unknown count drops to or below $\tau$ and
the row is not already in the heap, it is inserted. This check piggybacks on the existing propagation loop, which
already iterates forced assignments to record them on the undo stack (lines 245-247 in the current implementation).

**Cell selection.** At each branching decision, the solver checks the priority queue first:

1. If the heap is non-empty, extract the row $r^*$ with the smallest $u(\text{row})$. Select the most-constrained
   unassigned cell in row $r^*$ (using the existing per-row `computeCellScores(r)` or a simpler scan of the row's
   $u$ remaining cells). Branch on that cell.

2. If the heap is empty, fall back to the static ordering: advance `orderIdx` to the next unassigned cell in
   `cellOrder` and branch on it, exactly as the current implementation does.

**Undo integration.** When the solver backtracks past a branching decision that was drawn from the priority queue,
the unassigned cells in the affected row return to their unassigned state (via the existing undo stack). The row's
$u(\text{row})$ increases, and if it exceeds $\tau$, the row is removed from the heap. This requires tracking which
heap entries were added at which DFS depth, which can be accomplished with a small side stack of (row, depth) pairs
popped during undo.

#### B.4.4 DI Determinism

Dynamic cell selection must produce the same enumeration order in both the compressor and decompressor to preserve
DI semantics. This is guaranteed because the priority queue's behavior is a pure function of the constraint store
state:

(a) The constraint store state at any DFS node is fully determined by the input constraints and the sequence of
assignments made to reach that node.

(b) Both compressor and decompressor execute the same DFS with the same propagation engine, producing identical
constraint store states at each node.

(c) The priority queue's contents depend only on $u(\text{row})$ values, which are part of the constraint store
state. The cell selected within a priority row depends only on the per-row confidence scores, which are likewise
determined by the store state.

Therefore, both compressor and decompressor make identical cell-selection decisions at every node, and the
enumeration order is deterministic. No changes to the file format or DI encoding are required.

#### B.4.5 Cost Analysis

The per-decision overhead is bounded by the priority queue operations:

*Threshold check.* After propagation, the solver inspects $u(\text{row})$ for each row touched by forced
assignments. In the worst case, a single propagation wave forces cells in all $s$ rows, requiring $s = 511$
comparisons against $\tau$. This is a scan of 511 cached line statistics&mdash;comparable to the existing forced-
assignment recording loop and negligible relative to the propagation cost itself.

*Heap operations.* Each insert or extract-min costs $O(\log s) = O(9)$. At most $s$ rows can be in the heap
simultaneously. In practice, the number of rows crossing $\tau$ per propagation wave is small (typically 0-3),
so the amortized heap cost per decision is a few dozen instructions.

*Per-row scoring.* When the priority queue selects a row $r^*$, the solver must identify the best cell within
that row. A simple scan of the row's $u \leq \tau$ remaining cells, reading their 7 line residuals, costs $O(7\tau)$
operations. At $\tau = 8$, this is 56 stat lookups&mdash;under 200 ns on Apple Silicon.

The total per-decision overhead is approximately 200-500 ns, less than 10% of the current ~2 $\mu$s per iteration.
The throughput impact is negligible.

#### B.4.6 Expected Impact

The primary benefit is more frequent LH checks. In the current static-ordering regime, rows complete only when the
sequential scan happens to reach their remaining cells. With the priority queue, a row that reaches $u \leq \tau$ is
immediately prioritized, and its remaining cells are assigned within the next $\tau$ decisions. This reduces the
*latency* between a row becoming nearly complete (due to propagation) and the LH check firing.

The impact is largest in the mid-solve (rows 100-300), where propagation cascades from column, diagonal, and slope
constraints frequently force cells in rows far ahead of the current sequential position. These "accidentally
nearly-complete" rows represent free LH checks that the static ordering leaves on the table.

A conservative estimate: if the priority queue triggers even 10% more LH checks per unit time in the plateau region,
and each LH mismatch prunes an average subtree of depth $d$, the effective search-space reduction compounds
exponentially. At 200K mismatches/sec, a 10% increase yields 20K additional prunes/sec, each eliminating a subtree
of $O(2^d)$ nodes.

#### B.4.7 Threshold Selection

The threshold $\tau$ controls the tradeoff between responsiveness and distraction:

*$\tau = 1$.* The priority queue activates only when a single cell remains in a row. This is the most conservative
setting&mdash;the solver interrupts the static ordering only for guaranteed one-step row completions. The cost is
zero (no per-row scoring needed, only one candidate cell). The drawback is that rows at $u = 2$ or $u = 3$ are not
prioritized, missing opportunities where 2-3 assignments would yield an LH check.

*$\tau = 4$-$8$.* The priority queue activates for rows within a few cells of completion. This is the expected sweet
spot: the solver invests at most $\tau$ decisions to complete a row, and the LH payoff justifies the detour from the
static ordering. The per-row scoring cost is bounded by $O(7\tau) \leq 56$ stat lookups.

*$\tau = s$.* Every row is always in the priority queue, and the solver effectively abandons the static ordering
entirely in favor of a pure "complete the nearest row" strategy. This is likely suboptimal: it ignores constraint
tightness entirely and may direct the solver to rows where the remaining cells are weakly constrained, leading to
more backtracks.

#### B.4.8 Relationship to Adaptive Lookahead (B.8)

Dynamic row-completion priority and adaptive lookahead (B.8) address different aspects of the solver's performance
and should be evaluated independently. The priority queue modifies cell selection within the existing branching
framework, steering the solver toward earlier LH verification without changing the propagation or lookahead
machinery. Adaptive lookahead modifies the depth of speculative exploration at each branching decision, providing
stronger pruning when the solver stalls. Neither depends on the other.

That said, the two proposals are complementary if both are adopted. At lookahead depth $k = 0$, the solver's only
pruning mechanisms are cardinality forcing and LH checks. The priority queue maximizes the frequency of LH checks,
extracting more pruning power from the $k = 0$ regime and potentially delaying the first escalation to $k = 1$. This
preserves maximum throughput (~510K iter/sec) deeper into the solve. At higher $k$, the priority queue steers
lookahead probes toward cells on nearly-complete rows, where the probe is more likely to trigger an LH check during
speculative assignment, providing stronger pruning information per probe.
