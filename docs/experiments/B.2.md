### B.2 Auxiliary Cross-Sum Partitions as Solver Accelerators (Implemented)

This appendix originally proposed adding auxiliary cross-sum partitions to increase constraint density and accelerate
decompression. Four toroidal-slope partitions&mdash;HSM1 ($p = 256$), SFC1 ($p = 255$), HSM2 ($p = 2$), and SFC2
($p = 509$)&mdash;were initially integrated, but were subsequently replaced by four pseudorandom lookup-table partitions
(LTP1-LTP4) in B.20. The main specification (Sections 2.4, 3.1, 10.2-10.3, and 12.4) now reflects the LTP
architecture. The original toroidal modular-slope construction described in B.5 rather than the Hilbert-curve geometry
originally proposed here. The constraint store now manages $10s - 2 = 5{,}108$ lines (511 rows + 511 columns + 1,021
diagonals + 1,021 anti-diagonals + $4 \times 511$ slope lines), each cell participates in 8 constraint lines, and the
per-block payload is 125,988 bits (15,749 bytes) at a compression ratio of $C_r \approx 0.5175$ (51.8%).

The remainder of this section summarizes the analytical framework for evaluating the implemented design and assesses
the cost and benefit of adding further partitions.

#### B.2.1 Information-Theoretic Bounds

A cross-sum partition of $s$ groups of $s$ cells contributes at most $s \lceil \log_2(s+1) \rceil = 4{,}599$ bits of
constraint information. The 8 implemented partitions contribute a combined maximum of $6sb + 2B_d(s) = 43{,}982$ bits
of cross-sum information (where $b = 9$ for the 6 uniform-length families and $B_d(s)$ accounts for the variable-
length DSM and XSM encodings). This is far short of the $s^2 = 261{,}121$ bits needed to uniquely determine the
matrix. The kernel dimension of the linear constraint system is at least $s^2 - (10s - 2) = 255{,}013$, confirming
that cross-sum constraints alone&mdash;regardless of how many partitions are added&mdash;cannot replace the nonlinear
collision resistance provided by SHA-1 LH and SHA-256 BH.

The following table summarizes the current and hypothetical configurations:

| Configuration                        | Cross-sum bits | Lines   | Lines/cell | $C_r$  |
|--------------------------------------|----------------|---------|------------|--------|
| 4 original (LSM/VSM/DSM/XSM)        | 25,568         | 3,064   | 4          | 0.6989 |
| 8 implemented (+ LTP1/LTP2/LTP3/LTP4)| 43,982        | 5,108   | 8          | 0.5175 |
| 10 partitions (+ 1 pair)            | 53,180         | 6,130   | 10         | 0.4823 |
| 12 partitions (+ 2 pairs)           | 62,378         | 7,152   | 12         | 0.4471 |
| 16 partitions (+ 4 pairs)           | 80,774         | 9,196   | 16         | 0.3768 |

Each additional pair of toroidal-slope partitions costs $2sb = 9{,}198$ bits per block (3.5 percentage points of
compression ratio) and adds $2s = 1{,}022$ constraint lines.

#### B.2.2 Minimum Swap Size and Collision Resistance

The pigeonhole bound above is a loose upper bound that treats each partition's sums as independent. In practice,
interlocking partitions create tight dependencies: a single cell participates in one line from each of the 8
partitions, so flipping that cell perturbs 8 sums simultaneously. For a swap pattern to be invisible to the entire
partition system, it must produce zero net change on *every* line it touches.

With only LSM and VSM, the minimal invisible swap is a 4-cell rectangle with alternating $+1/-1$ flips. Adding DSM
and XSM breaks generic rectangles (the four cells fall on four distinct diagonals, each seeing an unbalanced flip),
raising the minimum swap size above 4 cells. Each additional toroidal-slope partition imposes further balance
constraints: the $k$ cells in a candidate swap must pair up within each slope line they touch, with equal $+1/-1$
split per line.

Let $k_{\min}$ denote the minimum swap size for an $n$-partition system. The expected number of collision partners
for a uniformly random matrix is bounded by:

$$
    E[\text{collisions}] \lessapprox \left(\frac{e \, s^2}{2k}\right)^k \cdot \exp(-nk \, e^{-k/s})
    \cdot 2^{-nk^2/(2s)}
$$

where the first factor counts $k$-cell subsets, the second enforces the no-singleton condition across $n$ partitions,
and the third enforces pairwise balance. The following table evaluates this bound at $n = 8$ (implemented) and
$n = 12$ (hypothetical) for representative swap sizes:

| $k_{\min}$ | $E[\text{collisions}]$ ($n = 8$) | $E[\text{collisions}]$ ($n = 12$) |
|:-----------:|:--------------------------------:|:---------------------------------:|
| 8           | $\approx 10^{14}$               | $\approx 10^{10}$                |
| 20          | $\approx 10^{15}$               | $\approx 10^{5}$                 |
| 50          | $\approx 10^{-8}$               | $\approx 10^{-50}$               |
| 80          | $\approx 10^{-75}$              | $\approx 10^{-157}$              |
| 100         | $\approx 10^{-138}$             | $\approx 10^{-260}$              |

For $n = 8$, the collision count drops below 1 at $k_{\min} \gtrsim 45$. For $n = 12$, this threshold drops to
$k_{\min} \gtrsim 25$. In either case, LH and BH provide the definitive collision guarantee ($\sim 10^{-30{,}000}$);
the cross-sum collision analysis is relevant only as a secondary assurance and for understanding the propagation
benefit.

#### B.2.3 Propagation Benefit of Additional Partitions

Each additional partition increases the number of constraint lines per cell. The propagator's forcing rules
($\rho = 0$ forces zeros, $\rho = u$ forces ones) trigger independently on each line. If $f$ denotes the per-line
forcing probability at a given search depth, the probability that a cell remains unforceable after propagation is
$(1 - f)^n$ for $n$ lines per cell. The reduction from $n = 8$ to $n = 10$ is:

$$
    \frac{(1-f)^{10}}{(1-f)^8} = (1-f)^2
$$

At a representative $f = 0.05$ (5% per-line forcing probability in the mid-solve), this reduces the unforceable
fraction by a factor of $(0.95)^2 = 0.9025$&mdash;a 10% reduction in the number of cells requiring branching decisions.
Because DFS tree size is exponential in the number of branch points, even a modest reduction compounds significantly.

The toroidal-slope construction guarantees 1-cell orthogonality between all partition pairs (Section 2.2.1): any two
lines from different partitions share exactly 1 cell. This means every assignment propagates information into every
other partition without redundancy. Additional slope pairs preserve this property provided $\gcd(p, 511) = 1$ and
$\gcd(|p_i - p_j|, 511) = 1$ for all existing slopes $p_j$. The current slopes $\{2, 255, 256, 509\}$ leave
abundant room for expansion&mdash;up to 255 total pairs are theoretically possible (see B.5.1(b)).

#### B.2.4 Implemented Design: Toroidal Modular-Slope Partitions

The original B.2 proposed Hilbert-curve-based PSM/NSM partitions implemented via static lookup tables. The actual
implementation uses toroidal modular-slope partitions instead, for three reasons:

*Analytical orthogonality.* The toroidal-slope construction provides a proof-backed guarantee that any two lines from
different partitions intersect in exactly 1 cell, via the $\gcd$-based argument in Section 2.2.1. Hilbert-curve
partitions have no such guarantee&mdash;their crossing density depends on the specific curve geometry and must be verified
empirically.

*Zero-overhead index computation.* Slope line membership is computed as $k = (c - pr) \bmod s$, which compiles to a
multiply-subtract-modulo sequence costing 1-2 cycles on Apple Silicon. The `ConstraintStore` precomputes flat
stat-array indices for all 4 slope families via `slopeFlatIndices(r, c)`, eliminating even the modular arithmetic from
the hot path. Hilbert-curve partitions would require a 510 KB lookup table per partition pair.

*Trivial extensibility.* Adding a new slope pair requires selecting a slope $p$ with $\gcd(p, 511) = 1$ and
$\gcd(|p - p_j|, 511) = 1$ for all existing slopes. No code-generation scripts, build-time lookup tables, or
curve-adaptation logic is needed.

#### B.2.5 Cost-Benefit of Further Partitions

Adding a fifth slope pair (10 partitions total) costs 9,198 bits per block, reducing $C_r$ from 51.8% to 48.2%&mdash;a
3.5 percentage-point penalty. The benefit is 1,022 additional constraint lines and an increase from 8 to 10
lines per cell. Whether this tradeoff is justified depends on the empirical decompression speedup.

The current solver plateaus at depth ~87K (row ~170) with 8 partitions. The plateau is a combinatorial phase
transition in the mid-rows where cardinality forcing is inactive and LH checks are the only strong pruning
mechanism. Additional partitions increase the per-assignment propagation radius but do not create new hash
checkpoints. The marginal benefit is therefore an increase in cardinality forcing frequency&mdash;more lines per cell
means more chances for a line's residual to reach 0 or $u$&mdash;but this benefit diminishes as the number of partitions
grows, because the residuals on the new lines are initially large (each slope line has $s = 511$ cells) and individual
assignments reduce them by at most 1.

The following qualitative assessment applies to the current plateau regime:

*Strong case for a 5th pair (10 partitions).* At 10 lines per cell, the probability of at least one forcing trigger
per assignment increases measurably. The 3.5-point compression cost is modest, and the propagation benefit is
concentrated exactly where the solver needs it&mdash;in the mid-rows where 8-line propagation is insufficient.

*Diminishing returns beyond 12 partitions.* At 12 lines per cell, the incremental forcing probability gain from each
additional pair is $(1-f)^2 \approx 0.90$, the same 10% relative reduction. But the compression cost accumulates
linearly: 12 partitions yield $C_r \approx 44.7\%$, and 16 partitions yield $C_r \approx 37.7\%$. The compression
ratio approaches the regime where CRSCE's overhead rivals the input size, undermining the format's purpose.

*Hard limit.* At $n = 28$ partitions (the maximum fitting within the information-theoretic budget), the compression
ratio drops to approximately 11%&mdash;effectively no compression. Long before this point, the solver's constraint
density is high enough that other bottlenecks (hash verification throughput, propagation queue overhead) dominate.
