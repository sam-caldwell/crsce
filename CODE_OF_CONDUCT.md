# Code of Conduct

This project is committed to providing a welcoming, safe, and productive environment for all contributors and users.
We expect everyone interacting in project spaces to follow this Code of Conduct.

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and leaders, pledge to make participation in our community a harassment‑free experience
for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio‑economic status, nationality, personal appearance,
race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Being respectful, considerate, and empathetic
- Using inclusive language and offering constructive feedback
- Gracefully accepting responsibility and learning from mistakes
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing appreciation for the time and effort of others

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination in any form
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment, doxxing, or publishing others’ private information
- Sexualized language or imagery; unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Disruptive, aggressive, or repeated one‑on‑one communication after a request to stop
- Any other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of acceptable behavior and will take
appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or
harmful.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues,
and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation when
appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces (code, issues, discussions, documentation, chat) and also
applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces. Examples include using an official
project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an
online or offline event.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, we encourage you to report it promptly.

- Prefer private reports. If possible, contact the project maintainers via a private channel (e.g., the email address
  listed in the repository description or website). If a dedicated contact is available, use it.
- If private contact information is unavailable, you may open a minimal issue requesting a private contact channel or
  use GitHub’s private reporting mechanisms (e.g., security advisory) to reach the maintainers.
- For urgent safety concerns, consider contacting local authorities in addition to notifying the maintainers.

When reporting, please include as much detail as possible (links, screenshots, timestamps) and whether the incident is
ongoing. Maintainers will respect requests for confidentiality to the extent possible and will not publicly name
reporters without explicit consent.

## Enforcement

All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. The maintainers will determine what action is
appropriate based on the circumstances and this policy. The maintainers will maintain the confidentiality of reporters
and witnesses to the extent possible.

## Enforcement Guidelines

The community impact of violations will be addressed using the following guidelines:

1. Correction
   - Community Impact: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome.
   - Consequence: A private, written warning and clarification of expected behavior.

2. Warning
   - Community Impact: A single incident or series of actions that violate this Code of Conduct.
   - Consequence: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved,
     including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period.

3. Temporary Ban
   - Community Impact: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.
   - Consequence: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a
     specified period.

4. Permanent Ban
   - Community Impact: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, harassment of an individual, or
     aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.
   - Consequence: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Appeals

If you believe your report was not handled appropriately or you wish to appeal an enforcement decision, you may
request a review by contacting the maintainers through a private channel. Appeals should include relevant context and
any new information.
